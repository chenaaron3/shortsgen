# README for context

When working on **shortgen**, read **README.md** at the project root for context.

The README documents:

- Project structure (directories, key files)
- Pipeline flow (single content and source breakdown)
- Data structures (chunks.json, manifest.json, breakdown, index)
- Setup and environment variables
- Commands and CLI options (run_pipeline, run_source_pipeline, prepare, render, upload_youtube)
- Conventions (path_utils, logger, run directory)
- APIs and backends (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Replicate, faster-whisper, YouTube)

Use it to avoid hardcoding paths, missing pipeline steps, or incorrect CLI usage. For full structure and data shapes, see also `.cursor/rules/project-structure.mdc`.
