title: The Downside of Good Habits

--- HOOK ---
Your habits might be secretly sabotaging your success.
--- BODY ---
When you do things on autopilot, you miss mistakes.
You settle for "good enough," and over time, your skills slip.
Improvement isn't just about forming habits; it's about refining them.
Self-awareness is your key. Without it, you get lost in daily routines.
--- CLOSE ---
Pause today. Reflect on one habit. Ask yourself: Is this helping me grow?
