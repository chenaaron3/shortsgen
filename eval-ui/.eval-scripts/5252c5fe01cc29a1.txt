title: Reclaiming Inner Happiness

--- HOOK ---
What if you already have everything you need for happiness?
--- BODY ---
The Dalai Lama believes everyone holds the potential for happiness and compassion. But most of us overlook this inner capacity. Time slips by faster than we realize. Are we wasting it on things that don't truly matter? By staying present and appreciating small moments, we align our actions with our true values.
--- CLOSE ---
Today, focus on one meaningful action that reflects your core values. That's where true happiness lies.
