title: Joy in the Process

--- HOOK ---
Why do some people stick with habits while others quit?
--- BODY ---
Imagine two runners. One runs to lose weight. The other runs because they love the feeling of the wind and the rhythm of their feet. The first stops as soon as they hit their goal. The second keeps running, rain or shine. Why? Because joy in the process keeps them going.

Find happiness in the journey, not just the finish line. It’s the secret to lasting success.
