title: The Power of Small Improvements

--- HOOK ---
The key to massive change is surprisingly tiny.
--- BODY ---
Imagine improving just 1% each day. Doesn't seem like much, right? But over a year, that small change compounds into a 37-fold improvement. It's like compound interest for self-improvement. Daily habits, no matter how small, shape your life's trajectory. Consistency in these habits determines your future—whether it's your health, finances, or knowledge. Good habits? They make time your friend. Bad ones? Time becomes your enemy.
--- CLOSE ---
Focus on one small habit today. Make it a daily ritual, and let time do the rest.
