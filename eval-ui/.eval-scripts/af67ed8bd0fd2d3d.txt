Struggling to stick to your goals? It might be simpler than you think.
--- BODY ---
Imagine waking up and knowing exactly what to do. No second-guessing, no waiting for motivation. It's possible with a simple trick: implementation intentions. Picture this: every day at 7 AM, you walk in the park. You've planned it. So when the time comes, you just go. No decisions needed.
--- CLOSE ---
Set one clear plan: "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]." Watch your habits stick like glue.
