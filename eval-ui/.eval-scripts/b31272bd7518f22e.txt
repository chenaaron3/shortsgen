title: Environment's Role in Habit Formation

--- HOOK ---
Motivation isn't the key to building habits—it's often something else.
--- BODY ---
Picture this: products you choose are influenced by where they're placed. 
A medication next to your bathroom faucet? You'll remember to take it. 
A guitar stand in your living room? You'll be more likely to practice. 
Social situations, too, cue behaviors based on their environment. 
It's all about redesigning your surroundings to make the right cues obvious.

Want to form a habit? Start by changing your environment—make cues impossible to miss.
