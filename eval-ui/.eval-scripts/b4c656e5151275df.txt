title: Making Habits Irresistible

--- HOOK ---
Why do some habits feel irresistible while others don't?
--- BODY ---
It's not just about the pleasure. Dopamine surges when you anticipate a reward. Imagine the excitement before a relaxing evening with your favorite show. That's dopamine at work. Temptation bundling taps into this by pairing a less appealing task with something you love. Like listening to an audiobook while you jog.
--- CLOSE ---
Combine a boring task with a treat. You'll find it hard to resist getting started.
