--- HOOK ---
What if your bad habits aren't the problem, but a symptom?
--- BODY ---
Think about this: smoking or scrolling aren't habits you crave.
What you truly desire is to calm anxiety, fit in, or feel important.
These habits are just your brain's way of trying to get there.
But if you change how you see them, you can change the habit itself.
--- CLOSE ---
Dig deeper—ask yourself, "What do I really want?" Then reshape your habits to meet that need.
