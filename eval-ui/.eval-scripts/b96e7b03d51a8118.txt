Imagine wanting to become a reader. You don't start with a novel—you start by reading just one page. Want to exercise? Just lay out your yoga mat. These are gateway habits, quick actions that jumpstart your journey. 

The Two-Minute Rule says your first step should take less than two minutes. If even that feels tough, just do the activity for two minutes and then stop.
