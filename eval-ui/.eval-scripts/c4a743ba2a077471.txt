title: Training the Mind for Happiness

--- HOOK ---
Happiness isn't a destination—it's a skill you can train.
--- BODY ---
Most people think happiness just happens. But it's more like a muscle.
Negative thoughts weigh you down, while positive ones lift you up.
It starts with noticing your thoughts—are they helping or hurting?
Small shifts in how you think can transform your well-being over time.
--- CLOSE ---
Start with this: Catch one negative thought today. Replace it with a positive one. Repeat.
