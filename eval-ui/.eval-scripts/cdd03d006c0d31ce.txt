title: Self-Created Suffering

--- HOOK ---
What if your suffering isn't about the situation, but about how you see it?
--- BODY ---
When things go wrong, it's easy to point fingers.
We focus on negative emotions, blame others, and the cycle of suffering continues.
But what if you paused and reassessed your role in the situation?
By seeing change as inevitable, you reduce anxiety.
This shift allows you to address mistakes rather than dwell on guilt.
--- CLOSE ---
Next time you're overwhelmed, ask: "What's my role here?" Accept change. Watch your resilience grow.
