title: Immediate Satisfaction in Habits

--- HOOK ---
Why do we keep choosing short-term pleasure over long-term success?
--- BODY ---
It's in our nature. We crave immediate rewards, even when we know the risks. That's why we reach for that cigarette or extra slice of cake. The pull of instant gratification is strong. Habits that bring us quick pleasure tend to stick. A tasty flavor or a pleasant scent can make these habits irresistible.
