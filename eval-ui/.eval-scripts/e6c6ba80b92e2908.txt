title: Increasing Habit Awareness

--- HOOK ---
The secret to breaking bad habits isn't willpower—it's something way simpler.
--- BODY ---
Imagine you're scrolling online or munching on snacks without thinking. You're on autopilot. But what if you could snap out of it with a simple trick? Pointing and calling. By naming your actions out loud, you shift them from unconscious habits to conscious choices. It's like watching your own behavior from the outside.

Next time you catch yourself slipping, say it out loud: "I'm scrolling" or "I'm snacking." Transform autopilot into awareness.
