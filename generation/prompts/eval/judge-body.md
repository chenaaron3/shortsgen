# Script Body Judge

Evaluate whether a short-form script **body** delivers value using Made to Stick (SUCCES). **Be strict.** Scripts must meet the bar of reference examples.

## What separates a good body from a bad one

Evaluate the body against these six (SUCCES). A **good body** has one clear core idea, setup then payoff—closes the loop the hook opened—and satisfies at least four of the six, **including at least one of Concrete or Credible**. A **bad body** fails on that bar: vague, no mechanism, no concrete detail, or repetitive.

**S – Simple**  
One core idea. You can state it in one sentence. No clutter, no tangents. If the body tries to cover two or three ideas, it fails Simple.

**U – Unexpected**  
Breaks a pattern or schema. "You think X" → then flip. Or a contrast: two people, two outcomes, same situation. Surprise or reframe that makes the viewer reassess. Purely linear explanation with no twist is weak on Unexpected.

**C – Concrete**  
At least one vivid, sensory example. Specific nouns and verbs—not "be disciplined" but "get up when it's cold." Numbers (37-fold, 80%, 30 seconds), names (Huberman, LeBron James, University of Queensland), or a scene you can see (glass of water, skatepark, cold shower). Abstract language alone fails Concrete.

**C – Credible**  
Mechanism or proof. *How* does it work? Cause-effect, step-by-step, or a named concept (e.g. cue-induced wanting). Or a study/source with a concrete detail—year, place, sample size, finding—not "experts say" or "studies show" with nothing specific. Assertions without mechanism or proof fail Credible.

**E – Emotional**  
Makes the viewer feel something: curiosity, relief, stakes, recognition, hope, unease. Purely informational with no emotional pull is weak on Emotional.

**S – Stories**  
Micro-story (situation → conflict or contrast → resolution) or at least a scenario with specificity—who, what, where, or what happened. Abstract advice with no scene or character fails Stories.

**Bad body (reject):** Stays abstract ("focus on joy", "build social bonds"). Metaphor without *how* ("compound interest for self-improvement" with no 1% → 37-fold). No numbers, names, or specific scene. Repetitive—same idea restated. Listicle that never closes the loop. "Experts say" / "studies show" with no concrete detail.

**Diagnostic:** (1) One idea in one sentence? (2) At least one concrete detail (number, name, or scene)? (3) Mechanism or proof? (4) Closes the loop (payoff)? If (2) or (3) is missing → lean FAIL.

## Reference (gold standard — good bodies)

All examples below are **body-style excerpts from `source/data.json`** (Improvement Pill, MotivationHub, and other popular YouTube channels). Use them as the bar for Concrete, Credible, and clear payoff.

### 1. Glass of water — micro-story + mechanism (Improvement Pill, "A Glass Of Water", ~92k views)
```
A psychologist walked into a room while teaching stress management. She raised a glass of water. Everyone expected "half empty or half full?" Instead she asked: how heavy is this glass? People said eight ounces, 16, 20. She replied: the weight doesn't matter—it depends how long I hold it. A minute, it's fine. A whole day, my arm goes numb, paralyzed, unbearable. The weight never changes, but the longer I hold it the heavier it becomes. Stresses and worries are like that. Think about them a while, nothing. All day long, you feel paralyzed. Put the glass down.
```
**Why it works:** Simple: stress = how long you hold it. Unexpected: flips "how heavy?" into "how long." Concrete: psychologist, glass, eight/16/20 ounces, minute vs whole day, numb, paralyzed. Credible: mechanism (duration → sensation → paralysis). Emotional: recognition, relief. Stories: full micro-story (scene → twist → analogy → payoff).

### 2. Study + numbers + named source (Improvement Pill, "How To Increase Your Testosterone", ~196k views)
```
The majority of your testosterone is produced during REM sleep—anything that interferes with sleep hurts your levels. Second: a study in 1983 found testosterone in men went up 21% right after a workout; lift heavy, compound exercises—squats, bench press. Third: the University of Queensland in 2010 sent researchers to a skatepark. They interviewed and recorded 96 male skateboarders doing tricks, took saliva samples. Skateboarders filmed by female researchers had 30% higher testosterone than those filmed by men. Being around and performing in front of potential mates spikes it.
```
**Why it works:** Simple: sleep, exercise, and social context affect testosterone. Concrete: 1983, 21%, University of Queensland, 2010, 96 skateboarders, 30%, saliva samples. Credible: named study, year, place, mechanism (REM, workout, presence of mates). Emotional: stakes (you can act on this). Clear payoff.

### 3. Named source + concrete method (Improvement Pill, "3 Studying Tips You Haven't Heard Of", ~2.9M views)
```
Use certain sounds to increase focus. Huberman recommends 40 Hz—either 5 minutes before a study session or during it. Second tip: overt visual focus. Stare at one thing for 30 seconds—a dot on the wall, a water bottle, your plant. Doesn't matter what, as long as you keep focus on that spot. Third: memory. Studies find a direct correlation between adrenaline and forming memories. The key is to spike adrenaline right after you learn. You can do that by jumping in a cold shower.
```
**Why it works:** Simple: sound, visual focus, and adrenaline after learning improve study/memory. Concrete: 40 Hz, 5 minutes, 30 seconds, dot/water bottle/plant, cold shower. Credible: Huberman named, studies, mechanism (adrenaline → memory formation). Emotional: "you can do this." Clear, actionable payoff.

### 4. Named example + concrete ritual (Improvement Pill, "How To Trick Your Brain into Doing ANYTHING!", ~73k views)
```
Certain routines or rituals put you in a state of mind—what I call the showtime trick. Like an actor putting on a costume before performing, or an athlete before their game. LeBron James throws chalk dust in the air before playing ball. These rituals tell your brain and body: it's show time. You're not born with them—you build the association, like building a habit. Create a new ritual and do something special immediately after the first three times.
```
**Why it works:** Simple: rituals trigger the right state. Concrete: LeBron James, chalk dust, costume, "show time." Credible: mechanism (ritual → association → state). Emotional: "you can do this too." Stories: named example + clear how-to.

### 5. Personal story + named concept (Improvement Pill, "The Easy Way to Learn and Remember", ~37k views)
```
I carry little waterproof notebooks. When I'm listening to a book and hit an aha moment—when the gears click—I record that lesson. Example: I was listening to Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins at the gym. He talked about the cookie jar method. I put down my weights, paused the audiobook, pulled out my notebook, wrote "cookie jar method" and a short summary, rewound the audio and listened again. In that incident I'm putting in 10 or 20 times more effort into that one piece of information—and that lesson has stuck with me ever since.
```
**Why it works:** Simple: extra effort at the "aha" moment makes it stick. Concrete: waterproof notebooks, David Goggins, Can't Hurt Me, gym, cookie jar method, rewind, 10–20x effort. Credible: named book/person, mechanism (effort at peak moment → retention). Stories: first-person micro-story with resolution.

### 6. Number + mechanism (Improvement Pill, "3 Ways To Create More Happiness", ~58k views)
```
Studies have found about 80% of the thoughts we have day to day are negative. Every negative thought comes with a negative feeling; positive thoughts do the opposite. If you want to be happy you need to fix the ratio of bad thoughts to good. Second: social bonds. Almost all humans have a built-in need for them—it's in our DNA. You have to have them or your brain will shrink and you're more likely to develop mental illness. Conversations are a form of play: exchange information, solve problems together. That creates happiness.
```
**Why it works:** Simple: fix the thought ratio; build social bonds. Concrete: 80%, DNA, brain will shrink, mental illness, play/conversations. Credible: studies, mechanism (ratio → feelings; bonds → brain health). Emotional: stakes (happiness, health). Clear payoff.

## Reference (what to reject)

**Vague, no mechanism:**
- "Good habits make time your friend. Bad ones? Time becomes your enemy." — no *how*, no concrete example. (Compare: "37-fold over a year" + compound interest is concrete+credible; "time your friend" alone is not.)
- "Focus on what brings joy." / "Build social bonds." — abstract, could apply to any video.

**Metaphor without explanation:**
- "It's like compound interest for self-improvement" with no explanation of *how* it compounds (e.g. 1% daily → 37-fold). The metaphor is fine only when the mechanism is spelled out.

**Thin concrete, no credible:**
- "A person who sees themselves as 'healthy' naturally adopts healthy habits." — one example, no study or named mechanism; feels like assertion. Add a study, a name, or a clear cause-effect and it can pass.

**No concrete detail:**
- "Imagine two runners" with no further specificity (no wind, no rhythm, no rain or shine). Pass when the scenario has sensory or specific detail.

**Repetitive or no payoff:**
- Same idea restated in three ways with no new detail or build.
- Listicle that never closes the loop: "tip one… tip two… tip three…" without one clear core idea and payoff.

**Vague authority:**
- "Experts say" / "Studies have found" with no number, name, or testable claim. Prefer "a study tracked 12,000 people for 32 years" or "cue-induced wanting" (named concept).

## Pass/fail rule

**PASS** if the body has a clear core idea and satisfies at least four of the six SUCCES criteria above, **including at least one of Concrete or Credible**. **FAIL** if vague, no mechanism/proof, repetitive, or generic (no concrete detail).

---

## Output

Return only valid JSON. The **critique must explain how the script meets or fails each SUCCES criterion** (one short phrase or sentence per letter):

```json
{"pass": true|false, "critique": "Simple: [how it meets or fails]. Unexpected: [how]. Concrete: [how]. Credible: [how]. Emotional: [how]. Stories: [how]. Verdict: [pass/fail because...]"}
```

Example critique: "Simple: one clear idea (identity drives habits). Unexpected: flips 'focus on outcomes.' Concrete: person who sees self as healthy—one example, no numbers. Credible: mechanism stated but no proof. Emotional: identity stakes. Stories: single scenario, thin. Verdict: fail—lacks Credible proof and stronger story."
