# Script Ending Judge

Evaluate whether a short-form script **ending (close)** makes the viewer feel they learned something concrete, without cheesy or generic language. **Be strict.**

## What separates a good ending from a bad one

A **good ending** lands the lesson in one of three ways: (1) **one specific action** the viewer can do—when, where, or how is clear; (2) **one question to ask** themselves or someone else, tied to the lesson; or (3) **one identity reframe**—a short statement that reframes who they are or how to see the situation. It emerges directly from the body. The viewer can do, say, or ask something tomorrow. No inspirational padding. No line that could end any self-improvement video.

Prefer endings that give a **script** (exact words to say or think), **when/how** (timing or sequence), and **no second-sentence fluff**. Strong closings: exact words to say ("Say to yourself: Wow, it was because of the changes I made…"; "Think to yourself: I am mentally strong"); when + how ("two hours before bed", "right after you learn", "immediately after the first three times"); one sentence = the payoff, with no tagline after ("That's the secret." / "Nothing fancy, just rinse and repeat."); optional one-line mechanism ("If you do not reward yourself your brain will have no incentive to remember"); reframe as one sharp line ("Embrace the pain and use it to transform yourself." / "Put the glass down."). Reject: theme without script ("Find happiness in the journey", "Choose your influences wisely"); action with no when/context; action + fluff sentence ("…Watch your habits stick like glue.", "…and let time do the rest"); polished caption-style ("That's where true happiness lies"); vague or long reframes.

A **bad ending** is vague ("choose your influences wisely"—how?), a platitude ("big changes begin with small steps"), motivational fluff ("watch your progress soar", "fuels your success"), a cheesy echo of the lesson ("not too much, but just right" for Goldilocks), or a generic CTA ("follow us for more helpful tips"). It doesn't give a concrete next step. It feels tacked on, not earned. If the ending has a good action or question but adds a second sentence that is fluff, the whole ending fails.

**Specificity:** The ending must be **actionable or askable**. "Put a book on your pillow tonight" passes; "make reading the last thing you do" adds a clear constraint. "Ask: Is this my task or theirs?" passes—exact question. "Choose your influences wisely" fails—no specific action or question. "Do one thing this week that no one will applaud you for" passes—one clear behavior, time-bound.

**No fluff:** Any phrase that could appear at the end of a generic motivational video fails. "And let time do the rest", "trust the process", "watch it soar", "the secret to lasting success", "let it guide you to growth"—reject. The closing line should be the content punchline, not a second sentence that softens it.

**Diagnostic:** (1) Can the viewer do one specific thing, ask one specific question, or adopt one clear reframe? (2) Is it tied to what the body taught? (3) Is there zero inspirational/platitude language? If (1) or (2) is no, or (3) has fluff → FAIL.

## Reference (gold standard — good endings)

All examples below are **closing lines from `source/data.json`** (Improvement Pill and other popular YouTube channels). Use them as the bar: specific action, internal dialogue to use, or reframe; tied to the lesson; no fluff.

**Action (specific, doable):**
- "So remember to put the glass down." (Improvement Pill, "A Glass Of Water" — stress = how long you hold it; action = put it down.)
- "Just go out there and start talking to more people. That's the secret." (Improvement Pill, "How To Improve Your Communication Skills" — practice; clear action.)
- "The key according to studies is to spike adrenaline right after you learn. You can naturally pump your adrenaline by jumping in a cold shower." (Improvement Pill, "3 Studying Tips You Haven't Heard Of" — when + how: after learning, cold shower.)
- "The ideal time to take a shower is around two hours before you plan on heading to bed." (Improvement Pill, "This Is How You Can Fall Asleep Faster" — specific timing, actionable.)
- "Work for a bit and then purposely reward yourself for a short period of time—sort of like how you would give a dog a treat after he does a trick." (Improvement Pill, "Improve Your Focus With These 3 Tips" — concrete strategy.)
- "All you need to do is purposely go out of your way to create a new ritual and make sure that you do something special immediately after the first three times." (Improvement Pill, "How To Trick Your Brain…" — when: after first three times.)
- "That's how you get someone to open up—by reducing your filter and asking assumption questions." (Improvement Pill, "Tips for Getting People To Open Up" — two concrete actions.)
- "You just have to make a habit of spending some time every single day playing around with this activity that you enjoy." (Improvement Pill, "How Can You Create MORE Happiness" — time-bound, every day.)
- "My final trick is to reward yourself. If you do not reward yourself your brain will have no incentive to remember this behavior and it will never become a habit." (Improvement Pill, productivity — action + one-line mechanism.)

**Internal dialogue / question to ask self:**
- "When you notice this improvement you need to say to yourself: Wow, it was because of the changes I made, because of the effort I put in, that I am now able to sleep better." (Improvement Pill, "This Is How To Stay Motivated!" — exact phrase to use; builds locus of control.)
- "After doing your workout routine, think to yourself: I am mentally strong." (Improvement Pill, "The Secret to Believing in Yourself!" — repeat new thoughts when you find proof.)
- "Just keep gathering proof and keep repeating your new thoughts to yourself. Nothing fancy, just rinse and repeat." (Improvement Pill, "The Secret to Believing in Yourself!" — conversational; no tagline.)

**Identity reframe (short, earned):**
- "If they reject you, embrace the pain and use it to transform yourself." (Improvement Pill, "How To Ask Out Your Crush In 3 Simple Steps" — reframe rejection as fuel.)

Common traits: specific, repeatable, zero inspirational fluff. Directly tied to the lesson. Viewer can act, say, or ask tomorrow.

## Reference (what to reject)

**From `source/data.json` (real transcript closings):**
- "Follow us for more helpful tips" — generic CTA, could end any video.

**Platitudes / inspirational fluff (reject):**
- "And let time do the rest" — cheesy cliché.
- "Big changes begin with small steps" — platitude, no specific action.
- "Watch your progress soar" / "Watch your habits stick like glue" — motivational fluff tacked on.
- "It's the secret to lasting success" — generic line that could follow any lesson.
- "Not too much, but just right" — cutesy echo (e.g. Goldilocks), no concrete step.
- "Let it guide you to growth" — vague.
- "…and watch how the fear of disappointing them fuels your success" — "fuels your success" is fluff; the action before it ("Create a habit contract today. Let others in on your goals") could stand alone.

**Vague (reject):**
- "Choose your influences wisely" — what specifically do I do? No action or question.
- "Find one habit that matches your strengths" — closer, but "watch your progress soar" after it fails; and "find one habit" is still a bit vague without a concrete next step.

**Rule:** If the ending has a good action or question but adds a second sentence that is fluff, the whole ending fails (e.g. "Set one clear plan: … Watch your habits stick like glue." — drop "Watch your habits stick like glue" and it would pass).

## Pass/fail rule

**PASS** only if: one clear action OR one question to ask OR one identity reframe; directly tied to the lesson; zero inspirational/platitude language; viewer can do/say/ask something tomorrow; feels earned.

**FAIL** if any of: platitude, motivational fluff, vague (no specific action or question), cheesy echo, generic CTA, or a fluff sentence tacked onto an otherwise good close.
