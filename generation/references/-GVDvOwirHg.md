[HOOK]
Most people fail at YouTube. Here's how to succeed.

[BODY]
Upload consistently. First: prioritize your time. Treat content creation like a job. Block time in your calendar and stick to it. Second: create a workflow. A simple repeatable process. Write ideas, batch film, schedule uploads. Efficiency kills excuses. Third: kill perfectionism. Your first video won't be perfect. Focus on progress, not perfection.

[CLOSE]
Start today. Film that video. Upload it. Consistency is your superpower.
