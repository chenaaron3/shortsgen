```
[HOOK]
Your fight isn't just your own.

[BODY]
Every struggle you face isn't just for today. It's for the family that looks up to you. The legacy you leave behind. The generation that follows in your footsteps. Your fight is a bridge to a future bigger than you.

[CLOSE]
When you're tempted to quit, remember: you're building something that lasts. Keep fighting.
