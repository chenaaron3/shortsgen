[HOOK]
Most people ruin their entire day in the first 10 minutes.

[BODY]
They wake up and grab their phone. Scroll social media. Check messages. Read bad news. They feel stressed before the day even begins. Without realizing it, they put their mind into chaos mode. Your first hour is powerful. It sets the mood, focus, and energy for the whole day. When you start with your phone, you start reacting to life. When you start with silence and focus, you take control. No phone. No distractions. Just you. Stretch. Journal. Breathe.

[CLOSE]
This one habit can completely change your life in 2026.
