```
[HOOK]
You can trick your brain into performing. It's called the showtime trick.

[BODY]
Like an actor putting on a costume. Like LeBron throwing chalk before a game. Certain routines or outfits put you in a state of mind. They tell your brain: it's showtime. Give it your all. You're not born with these rituals—you build the association. Create a ritual. Do something special immediately after. Do it three times. The habit forms.

[CLOSE]
Pick one ritual. Put it on before the thing that matters. Your brain will follow.
