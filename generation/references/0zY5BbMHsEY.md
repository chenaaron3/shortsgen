[HOOK]
You won't succeed if you're a slave to your phone and feeds.

[BODY]
Take back control. Three strategies. One: fight fire with fire. Use News Feed Eradicator or similar apps to kill the feed on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube. Two: change your environment. Working from home is near impossible if that's where you relax. Go to a cafe. Three: train yourself like a dog. Work for a bit, then reward yourself. A short break. A treat. Same way you'd train any habit.

[CLOSE]
Make the machines work for you. Not the other way around.
