[HOOK]
The search for happiness in a bottle never ends well.

[BODY]
Many turn to alcohol, thinking it'll lead to happiness—a lifestyle promise. But here's the twist: you wake up one morning, and the happiness isn't there. I drank, thinking it would fill the void, but the emptiness remained. In high school, we heard "don't do drugs," yet alcohol slipped through the cracks. It's the social glue, so pervasive we hardly question it.

[CLOSE]
Instead of seeking happiness in a glass, find a purpose worth staying sober for. One that lights you up without the hangover.
