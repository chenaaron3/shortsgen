[HOOK]
The Japanese have a formula for happiness. It has four parts.

[BODY]
Ikigai means a reason for being. You need something you love, something you're good at, something that pays, and something the world needs. If you only have love and skill—that's a passion. Love and world need—a mission. Pay and skill—a profession. Pay and world need—a vocation. Without all four, you'll always feel like something is missing.

[CLOSE]
Find where your love, skill, pay, and purpose overlap. That's ikigai.
