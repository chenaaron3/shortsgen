[HOOK]
Pranayama meditation controls your breath—and your stress.

[BODY]
Breath control. Often taught as the 4-4-4-4 box: breathe in for four seconds, hold four, exhale four, wait four. Repeat. Benefits: lowers blood pressure, reduces stress, helps you fall asleep. It's one of the only meditation forms shown to strengthen your lungs. Who it's for: anyone with stress or anxiety.

[CLOSE]
Four in. Four hold. Four out. Four wait. Your nervous system will thank you.
