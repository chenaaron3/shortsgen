[HOOK]
Why do eagles never fly in flocks?

[BODY]
Eagles soar alone. They hunt without a pack, relying only on their own strength and cunning. They don’t wait for help or guidance. No mentor, no handouts. Just their sharp instincts and will.

[CLOSE]
Remember, like the eagle, sometimes you must rely on your own strength. Trust your instincts and take flight.
