[HOOK]
The pain you're feeling? It's not what you think.

[BODY]
You're facing discomfort, feeling isolated, and it's tempting to see it as failure.
But this is the sign of someone who's willing to sacrifice for their goals.
Every person hits a lonely chapter—a moment where clarity strikes.
It's the realization that to have more, you must become more.

[CLOSE]
Embrace this chapter. It's not the end, but the beginning of success.
