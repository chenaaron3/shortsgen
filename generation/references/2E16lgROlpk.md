[HOOK]
Ever wonder why bullies bully? It's not what you think.

[BODY]
Picture this: a person lashing out, spreading negativity.
It's easy to assume they're just mean.
But here's the twist—happy people don't hurt others.
When people hurt, they project their pain outward.
They drag others to their level because they can't cope internally.

[CLOSE]
Next time someone tries to bring you down, remember: it's not about you.
Stay focused on your goals and let their pain pass by.
