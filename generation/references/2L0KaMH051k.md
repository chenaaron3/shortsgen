[HOOK]
Did you know you're living in countless versions of other people's minds?

[BODY]
Some see you as different. Some may even think you're weird. But that's not a bad thing. Your uniqueness is your strength. It's what makes you beautiful and amazing. When others have opinions about you, it's none of your business. Those opinions don't define you.

[CLOSE]
Remember, the only opinion that truly matters is the one you hold about yourself. Embrace your uniqueness.
