[HOOK]
Want to master a skill? It starts before your day even begins.

[BODY]
Every morning, I dive into a cold plunge. It's my wake-up call. But that's just the beginning. For 12 years, I've practiced Zen meditation—45 minutes of pure mental reset. It's my way to clear the clutter. Then, an ice bath, a nutrient-packed meal, and a workout. This is my morning ritual.

[CLOSE]
Start your day by investing in yourself. Find one thing that centers you and make it a daily habit.
