[HOOK]
A note-taking habit that makes lessons stick.

[BODY]
I carry waterproof notebooks. When I'm listening to a book and hit an aha moment—I stop. I write it down. Example: David Goggins' cookie jar method. I put down my weights, paused the audiobook, pulled out my notebook. Wrote the lesson. Rewound the audio. Listened again. I put 10 to 20 times more effort into that one piece. It stuck. Forever.

[CLOSE]
When a lesson hits—pause. Write it. Listen again. The effort makes it stick.
