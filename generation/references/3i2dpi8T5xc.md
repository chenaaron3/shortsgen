[HOOK]
What if your vision for yourself isn't big enough?

[BODY]
Picture this: You visualize your future self. But how high do you really aim? There's no right or wrong answer, but here's the key—see yourself at your absolute peak. Push your imagination beyond its comfort zone. Imagine being so ambitious, it's almost delusional. That's where growth begins.

[CLOSE]
This week, write down a version of yourself that feels just out of reach. Aim for that.
