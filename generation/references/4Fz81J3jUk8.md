[HOOK]
What if you could reshape your reality with just your thoughts?

[BODY]
Imagine sitting down, letting your body completely relax. Now, in your mind, see the person you want to become. Capture that vision. Write it out in the present tense: "I am so happy now that I see myself..." Make it vivid and real. 

[CLOSE]
Carry that vision with you. Read it every day. Let your future self guide your present actions.
