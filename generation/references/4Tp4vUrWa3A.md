```
[HOOK]
Your past doesn't define your future. But here's what does.

[BODY]
We've all got work to do, destinies to fulfill. Rooms to enter, stages to stand on. Yet, too often, we get stuck on past pain. We forget to celebrate the lessons we've learned. We overlook the gift of the present moment. 

[CLOSE]
Unpack the present. Let it fuel your drive. Your future is waiting—go make it happen.
```
