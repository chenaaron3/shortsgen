[HOOK]
What does the American dream really look like?

[BODY]
Imagine starting your journey on a boat. Then spending a year in a refugee camp. It seems like a story from a movie, right? But for some, it's reality. Against all odds, they find themselves on Hollywood's biggest stage. 

[CLOSE]
Remember, no dream is too big. Your story can be the next American dream.
