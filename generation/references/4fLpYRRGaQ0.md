[HOOK]
Productivity is mostly a mental battle.

[BODY]
Remove distractions before they appear. Even in a new location, you bring devices that trigger old habits. Fourth trick: let yourself win easily. We set the bar too high. If you believe something is too hard, you'll find excuses. Lower the bar. Hit it more often. Fifth: reward yourself. Without rewards, your brain has no incentive to remember the behavior. It never becomes a habit.

[CLOSE]
Lower the bar. Reward the win. Your brain will repeat what gets rewarded.
