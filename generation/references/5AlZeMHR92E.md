[HOOK]
What's the real secret behind Kobe Bryant's legendary work ethic?

[BODY]
Imagine walking into the gym, and there he is—Kobe Bryant, already drenched in sweat. You work out for an hour and a half, but he's still going. It's game day, and he’s practicing like it's the finals. You play the game, and he drops 40 points on you. Afterward, you have to ask—why the relentless grind?

[CLOSE]
Kobe's answer? "No matter how hard you work, I'm willing to work harder." Next time you think you've given your all, remember: there's always another level.
