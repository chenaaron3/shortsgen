[HOOK]
It took 15 years to build an NBA career... and just 7 seconds to lose it.

[BODY]
It's not time we're short on; it's direction and commitment. Who you spend time with shapes who you become. You must focus if you want to defeat yesterday's version of yourself. True identity isn't tied to problems—it's about who you are beyond them. Once you find your spot, lock in. Get focused, get stable. Don't move.

[CLOSE]
Step onto the court, run the field, enter the arena. Try again. Each step back is just a setup for a comeback. Be relentless. Be a champion.
