```
[HOOK]
Every success carries a hidden shadow.

[BODY]
Think of yin and yang—light and dark, always together. When you achieve something great, darkness isn't far behind. It's not a curse, it's balance. Success brings its own challenges, demanding vigilance for what anchors us.

[CLOSE]
Next time you win, ask yourself: What's the hidden challenge in this victory?
