[HOOK]  
Ever wake up and think, "I just can't do it today"?

[BODY]  
Your mind is a tricky place. One day, you're motivated. The next, you're resisting. It's like a box of surprises. You might think people love going to the gym daily. Newsflash: no one does. The truth is, even gym enthusiasts struggle with this. Consistency isn't about loving it—it's about doing it despite the resistance.

[CLOSE]  
Next time you hesitate, remember: challenge the surprise. Show up, even when you don’t want to. That's real consistency.
