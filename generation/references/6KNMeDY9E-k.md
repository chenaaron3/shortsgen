[HOOK]
Three ways to boost testosterone. One of them might surprise you.

[BODY]
First: sleep. Most testosterone is produced during REM. Protect your sleep. Second: lift heavy. A 1983 study found a 21% spike right after a workout. Squats, bench press—compound moves. Third: a Queensland study sent researchers to a skatepark. Male skateboarders filmed by female researchers had 30% higher testosterone than those filmed by men. Being around and performing for potential mates changes your chemistry.

[CLOSE]
Sleep. Lift. Put yourself in situations where you perform. Your body responds.
