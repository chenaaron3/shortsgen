[HOOK]
Why do small mistakes often spiral into bigger failures?

[BODY]
Imagine you're racing and in the first corner, you lock up a tire. You lose your line. Most people start obsessing about fixing it in the next turn. But that mindset ruins the whole lap. Success in racing—or life—depends on a skill: the ability to let go of mistakes, no matter their size. It's about being self-honest—admitting "I messed up"—and then focusing on what you can do next.

[CLOSE]
Next time you slip, ask yourself: "What can I learn and improve?" Then move forward without looking back.
