```
[HOOK]
Trying to be someone else is the fastest way to nowhere.

[BODY]
You mimic others to impress people you don't even know. It feels smart—until it doesn't. Over time, you start resenting the persona you've crafted. Then comes burnout. You lose passion. The dream you're chasing slips away.

[CLOSE]
Embrace your true self. It's the only path to lasting growth.
