[HOOK]
I doubled my productivity with five simple tricks.

[BODY]
First: find an exclusive location for work. A place with no other associations. I moved to a local cafe. Second: don't give yourself time to think. Procrastination is emotional. The more you think about how much you have to do, the worse you feel. Take quick action. When I wake up, I only think: get dressed, go to the cafe. That's it. The habit does the rest.

[CLOSE]
Pick one location. One next action. Let the routine carry you.
