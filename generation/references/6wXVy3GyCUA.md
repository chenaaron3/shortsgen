```
[HOOK]
Confidence isn't about being accepted by others.

[BODY]
Imagine walking into a room full of strangers. Your mind races: "Will they like me? Will I fit in?" But true confidence isn't about their acceptance. It's about yours. When you accept yourself, your value isn't tied to their opinions. You can face any situation because you trust yourself.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're in a new place, remind yourself: "I accept me." That's where real confidence lives.
