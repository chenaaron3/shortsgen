```
[HOOK]
Your past can either fuel you or drain you. Here's the difference.

[BODY]
Think of your past as a bank account. If it's an asset, it pays you interest. It makes your present and future richer. You see every experience as a stepping stone. But if it's a liability, it drains you. It holds back your present and future. The secret is how you frame those experiences.

[CLOSE]
Reframe your past as a series of lessons. Let it pay dividends. Make it work for you.
