```
[HOOK]
Blame isn't the secret to a meaningful life—it's holding you back.

[BODY]
Think about it: when you blame others, does it make you feel proud? No. There's no self-esteem in pointing fingers. True self-worth comes from what you experience about yourself, not what others say. Yet, many are trapped in a culture that encourages blame, keeping them from feeling truly alive.

[CLOSE]
Break free from this cycle. Focus on what you can do, not what others did to you. That's where fulfillment starts.
