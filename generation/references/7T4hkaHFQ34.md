[HOOK]
Your big break might start with something small.

[BODY]
You're chasing a dream, aiming for the top. But what if the key is right where you are? Maybe it's cleaning bathrooms or singing for kids. Sounds simple, right? Yet, these small tasks might be your stepping stones.

[CLOSE]
Focus on mastering where you are now. That small step could lead you to the world stage.
