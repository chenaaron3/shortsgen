```
[HOOK]
Ever wonder how random events lead to life's biggest moments?

[BODY]
Looking forward, life is a mystery. But look back, and every dot connects like a scientific formula. That red light you caught? It delayed you just enough to meet someone who changed your life. What seemed like an end was really a beginning. 

[CLOSE]
Embrace the unknown. Trust that today's randomness might be tomorrow's turning point.
