[HOOK]
I created a ritual before dates. It changed everything.

[BODY]
I got extremely nervous. So I built a routine. On the 30 to 45 minute ride to the date: meditate. Be present. At my stop: three short, fun interactions with strangers. Talking to strangers made me less nervous. The interactions were usually positive—so I arrived in a good mood. Then during the date: be fun and present. I did this three times. It became a ritual. Less nervous each time.

[CLOSE]
Build a ritual before the thing that scares you. Repeat it. The fear fades.
