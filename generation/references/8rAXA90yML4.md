[HOOK]
It took me 15 years to build my NBA career... and just 7 seconds to lose it.

[BODY]
We often think we lack time, but what we truly lack is direction and commitment. Who you spend time with shapes who you become. The real competition? It's not others—it's the person you were yesterday. Your identity isn't your problems; it's who you are beyond them. Once you find your spot, you must focus, stabilize, and hold firm.

[CLOSE]
Step onto the court again, run the field again, and embrace the challenge. Compete with the old you, and you'll come back stronger every time.
