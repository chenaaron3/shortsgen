```
[HOOK]
Before anyone else believes in you, there's one person who must.

[BODY]
Imagine you're in an auditorium, and there's just one person clapping. That's you. It's the slow clap of self-belief. When you're chasing a dream, it often feels lonely because you're creating something that doesn't exist yet. You have a vision, a goal that only you can see.

[CLOSE]
Be your own biggest fan. Clap for yourself until the world joins in.
