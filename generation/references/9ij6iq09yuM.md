[HOOK]
Why aren't you satisfied with what you have?

[BODY]
Your mom might say, "You have a bike, a roof, food—be grateful." But something's missing. It's not about having things; it's about deciding what you want from life. Success isn't just about stuff. It's about obsession—knowing exactly what you want and constantly striving to improve. Everyone doubts themselves. Every step feels uncertain. That's why faith—not just in things, but in yourself—is crucial.

[CLOSE]
Today, decide on one thing you truly want. Let that drive you. Your mind can make it real.
