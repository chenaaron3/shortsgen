[HOOK]
This is you laying in bed watching YouTube. This is you taking small steps every day.

[BODY]
The difference is just 30 minutes a day. Working on your dreams instead of scrolling. Thirty minutes compounds. It becomes a habit. It gets easier every day. The key is starting. Now.

[CLOSE]
Start now. Make it a habit. You can do it.
