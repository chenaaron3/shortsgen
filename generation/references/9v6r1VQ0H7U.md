[HOOK]
Your ambition isn't what you think it is.

[BODY]
We often chase jobs for money, but there's a deeper aim. Real ambition is about becoming truly competent. Imagine focusing on learning, not just earning. It’s about choosing growth over a paycheck. Every mistake becomes a lesson, a chance to get smarter. The path to competence isn't easy, but it's the only one that leads to a richer life.

[CLOSE]
Next time you choose a job, ask yourself: "What will I learn here?" Make competence your ambition.
