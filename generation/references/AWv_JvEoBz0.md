[HOOK]
Holding onto past hurt? It's poisoning your success.

[BODY]
Imagine someone wronged you deeply. The instinct is to hold onto that anger. But here's the truth: clinging to past pain acts like a slow poison. It eats away at your happiness and success. You might think you're justified in holding on. But ask yourself: is it worth the cost?

[CLOSE]
Let go of that anger. Free yourself to thrive, unburdened by the past.
