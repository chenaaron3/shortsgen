[HOOK]
The sweet addiction lurking in your diet might surprise you.

[BODY]
Even vegetables pack some sugar, but the real culprits are sugar and high fructose corn syrup. These sweeteners sneak into your meals, playing a hidden role in serious health issues. They contribute to Alzheimer's, hypertension, and diabetes by causing inflammation and oxidative stress. The addiction is strong, and the consequences are everywhere.

[CLOSE]
Next time you reach for something sweet, ask yourself: "Is this worth the risk?"
