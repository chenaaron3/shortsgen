[HOOK]
Ever wonder why some people seem to win against all odds?

[BODY]
Picture this: the odds are stacked against you. Most would say it's luck if you succeed. But there's a secret mindset that separates winners from the rest. It's not about chance. It's about creating your own opportunities. While others wait for luck, some take control and make things happen.

[CLOSE]
Next time you face a challenge, ask yourself: Are you waiting for luck, or are you making your own?
