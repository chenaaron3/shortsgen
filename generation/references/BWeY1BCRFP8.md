[HOOK]
Chasing happiness? It might be the trap holding you back.

[BODY]
Happiness is a tricky thing. It hinges on outcomes—win, and you're happy. Lose, and it's gone. The problem? We keep raising the bar. It's a cycle that leaves you unsatisfied. But Joy? Joy is different. It's not an outcome; it’s constant. It comes from doing what you're meant to do, regardless of results.

[CLOSE]
Seek joy through your actions, not the outcomes. Let it be your constant companion.
