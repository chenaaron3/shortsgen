[HOOK]
What if the validation you seek is pushing you toward destruction?

[BODY]
You chase approval, but it always slips away. You think "just a little more" will fill the gap. But that cycle traps you. Without realizing it, you look for escapes. For some, it's drugs or alcohol. The regret grows. You spiral, doing and saying things you wish you hadn't. 

[CLOSE]
Ask yourself: Is the chase worth losing yourself? Find value within, not through others.
