[HOOK]
What's the secret to a life well-lived? It's not what you'd expect.

[BODY]
Look at Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist. Known for playing Bongo drums naked on a roof, he picked up painting in his 60s. Feynman had a childlike curiosity, never rigid, never stuck. He embraced new experiences and skills. This kept him vibrant and adaptive, never a curmudgeon.
