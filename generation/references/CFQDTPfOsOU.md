[HOOK]
What if the key to happiness is being willing to change who you are?

[BODY]
Life's going to be tough sometimes. You can't avoid that. But here's a secret: You don't have to cling to one identity. You might see yourself as an author, a leader, or something else. But what happens if you let that go? When you detach from the need to be seen a certain way, you open yourself to growth and change.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're stuck, ask yourself, "What if this identity no longer serves me?" Be ready to evolve.
