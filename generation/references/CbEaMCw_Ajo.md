```
[HOOK]
Are you stuck discussing people instead of ideas?

[BODY]
It's tempting to complain about what life throws at you. Dwelling on others' actions is easy. But here's the secret: small minds discuss people. Good minds talk about events. And great minds? They focus on ideas. Transform your mindset by shifting the conversation from gossip to growth.

[CLOSE]
Next time you catch yourself talking about someone, pause. Ask, "What's the bigger idea here?"
