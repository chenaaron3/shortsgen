[HOOK]
What if you could reshape your entire self-image with just one simple habit?

[BODY]
Imagine sitting down, letting your body fully relax. Now, picture the person you want to become. See every detail clearly. Next, put it into words. Write it in the present tense: "I am so happy now that I see myself as..." Then read it. Read it again and again. Let it sink in.

[CLOSE]
Carry this vision with you. Read it daily, and watch your self-image transform.
