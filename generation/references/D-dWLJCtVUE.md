[HOOK]
Think alcohol makes life fun? Here's the twist.

[BODY]
I used to drink heavily, thinking it made weekends wild and weekdays bearable. But when you're having 15 or 20 drinks a week, you're always drunk or hungover. Alcohol seems like it boosts mood and cuts anxiety. But here's the catch: it's a mitochondria disruptor. That buzz? It's masking deeper damage. 

[CLOSE]
Next time you think a drink will add fun, ask: is it truly fun… or just a temporary escape?
