[HOOK]  
Success is the biggest drug you'll ever face.

[BODY]  
You can't avoid making dumb mistakes. They're part of the journey. Even when you know right from wrong, mistakes will happen. Here's the twist: success makes you feel invincible. When everything's handed to you, it's easy to think you can't fail. But that's when you're most vulnerable.

[CLOSE]  
Keep your back against the wall. Embrace mistakes as lessons and stay grounded. That's how you truly grow.
