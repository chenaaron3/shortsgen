[HOOK]
The secret to consistent success isn't talent or luck.

[BODY]
High performers don't ride the highs and crash with the lows. Instead, they thrive on steady progress. How? They see the journey, not just the destination, as rewarding. While others chase peaks, they find joy in the grind.

[CLOSE]
Next time you face a challenge, celebrate the effort. Attach your happiness to the process, not just the results.
