[HOOK]
What if your future self is a total stranger to you?

[BODY]
Life moves faster than we think. One moment, Max is six, playing in the car wash. Next, he's off to college. Just yesterday, you were young and carefree. Now, everything's changed in a blink. Imagine this: when you die, you meet the person you were meant to be. The question is, will you recognize them?

[CLOSE]
Focus on becoming the best version of yourself. Make sure when you meet your future self, you're identical twins.
