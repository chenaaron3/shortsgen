```
[HOOK]
What would you want people to remember you for?

[BODY]
Imagine someone approaches you, desperate for help, saying, "I can't stop drinking." If you can genuinely say, "Yes, I can help," and follow through, that's powerful. It's not about being remembered for friendships or accolades. It's about being remembered for the impact you make in someone's life. 

[CLOSE]
Decide today what legacy you want to leave. Then live every day proving it.
