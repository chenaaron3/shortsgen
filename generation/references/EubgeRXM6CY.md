[HOOK]
Ever feel like life is just chaos you can't control?

[BODY]
Imagine you're sailing. The wind is fierce, unpredictable. You can't control it. But you can adjust your sails. Life's challenges are like that wind. They might knock you off course. They might seem overwhelming. But the real power lies in how you respond. It's not about what happens to you. It's about how you react.

[CLOSE]
Next time life throws a storm your way, remember: adjust your sails. Choose your response.
