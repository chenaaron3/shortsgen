[HOOK]
The secret to achieving big goals starts with a tiny act.

[BODY]
Imagine beginning each day by making your bed. That simple task gives you a sense of pride. It sets the stage for tackling the next challenge, then another, and another. By day's end, this small victory has snowballed into many accomplishments. It's not just about a tidy bed—it's a powerful reminder.

[CLOSE]
Start tomorrow by making your bed. Nail the small stuff, and watch the big stuff fall into place.
