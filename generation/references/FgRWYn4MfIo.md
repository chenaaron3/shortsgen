[HOOK]
Chasing happiness? That's why you feel let down.

[BODY]
Happiness is a slippery slope. Win, and you're happy. Lose, and you're not. It's an "if-then" loop that keeps moving the goalpost. You hit one milestone, and another pops up. But if happiness is your goal, disappointment is inevitable. Happiness relies on results.

[CLOSE]
Instead, seek joy. Joy isn't tied to outcomes. It's found in doing what you love, regardless of success or failure.
