[HOOK]
The third way to create happiness: become one with the Muse.

[BODY]
Flow state. One hundred percent focus. Every action flows effortlessly. You don't think—your body does. In flow, your brain floods you with dopamine, endorphins, serotonin. How to get there more often: pick something you enjoy. A hobby, work, a skill. Anything that lets you be creative. Make a habit of playing with it every day.

[CLOSE]
Find the thing that absorbs you. Do it daily. Flow follows.
