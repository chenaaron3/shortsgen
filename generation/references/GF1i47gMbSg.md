[HOOK]
What if I told you that being the hero isn't just for stories?

[BODY]
Every day you play a role. You decide if you're the leader or the follower.
You craft the narrative of your life.
Some see obstacles, others see opportunities.
It's how you frame your story that defines your reality.

[CLOSE]
Start today. Rewrite your script. Be the hero in your own life.
