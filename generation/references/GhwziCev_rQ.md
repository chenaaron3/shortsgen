[HOOK]
What if your mind is shaping your reality more than you think?

[BODY]
Your mind has the power to manifest your dreams—and to sabotage them.
It's more influential than we realize. The world isn't just what we see.
According to the observer effect, nothing truly exists until it's observed.
Your mind is the creator and the critic.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're stuck, ask yourself: "What am I observing into reality right now?"
