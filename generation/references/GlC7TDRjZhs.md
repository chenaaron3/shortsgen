[HOOK]
Ever wondered why some people never seem to have a bad day?

[BODY]
It's not luck. It's their mindset. Imagine your mood as a thermostat. You can set it to a comfortable level. Maybe you'll have a bad moment or a rough hour, but never a bad day. Here's how: Master the three Ws—Want it, Work it, Win it. This isn't just a catchphrase. It's a formula.

[CLOSE]
Next time things go south, ask yourself: "How am I setting my thermostat?" Shift it up. Control your day.
