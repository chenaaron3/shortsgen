[HOOK]
Do you know who the biggest obstacle in your life is? Hint: It's not who you think.

[BODY]
We often worry about feeling embarrassed or judged by others. But here's the truth: you're not the center of their world. Most people are too busy with their own struggles. Misery loves company, so they pull you down. But their opinions aren't your chains.

[CLOSE]
Next time doubt creeps in, remember: focus on hard work, dedication, and your goals. You're the only one who can hold yourself back.
