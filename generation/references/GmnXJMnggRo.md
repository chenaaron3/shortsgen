[HOOK]
What if understanding your dark side could lead to a better you?

[BODY]
Imagine the person you could become—not just the good, but the terrible. Contemplating your potential for malevolence shines a light on who you truly are. It's unsettling to think you could be a force for ill. But recognizing your darker potential makes the path to a better self clearer.

[CLOSE]
Next time you reflect, don't shy away from your shadow. Use it to illuminate the person you aspire to be.
