[HOOK]
Courage isn't just what you think it is.

[BODY]
I used to believe courage was about medals and heroic acts. The kind of bravery that earns recognition. But I've learned it's more than that. True courage is the unseen struggle—the soldier who laces up his boots daily, ready to face the unknown. No fanfare, no headlines.

[CLOSE]
Next time you doubt yourself, remember: courage is showing up, even when no one's watching.
