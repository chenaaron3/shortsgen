[HOOK]
What if your biggest strength is something others call crazy?

[BODY]
When you're making lots of money, your focus is praised. It's seen as drive. But when you're not yet successful, that same focus can make you seem like a lunatic. Imagine thinking about the same thing 16 hours a day for seven days straight. Sounds extreme, right? Yet, for some, it's not work—it's a natural state.

[CLOSE]
Embrace your obsession. It might just be your superpower. Keep grinding, even when no one's watching.
