[HOOK]
Life will test everyone. But how you respond is the real challenge.

[BODY]
Imagine you're dealt a bad hand. Life throws adversity your way. For some, it crushes them. For others, it ignites a fire. The difference? It's not what's in the hand—it's what's within you. Adversity can break the weak or forge the strong. 

[CLOSE]
When life tests you, let it reveal your strength. Rise up and face the challenge.
