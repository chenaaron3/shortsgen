[HOOK]
Ever wonder why some people thrive in tough times?

[BODY]
Think about this: Weak times create strong people, and strong people create great times. But here's the catch—you can't complain about winter when it's cold. Many Fortune 1000 companies, like Disney and FedEx, were born in economic winters. Surviving tough times builds resilience, but what's key is your focus. At any moment, you choose what captures your attention. That focus gives meaning, and meaning fuels your actions.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're in a challenging season, ask: "What can I focus on that makes me stronger?"
