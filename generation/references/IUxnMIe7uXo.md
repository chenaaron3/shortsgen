[HOOK]
Did you know sugar is more than just a sweet treat? It's a silent saboteur.

[BODY]
For the first time, more people are overweight than underweight, and sugar is a major culprit. It's hidden everywhere—sauces, coffee, you name it. We're consuming a staggering 77 grams of added sugar daily. That's not just a number, it's a ticking time bomb. This excess sugar fuels obesity, diabetes, and even Alzheimer's.

[CLOSE]
Next time you reach for that sugary drink, think twice. Choose water. Your future self will thank you.
