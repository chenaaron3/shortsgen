```
[HOOK]
Fall asleep in 10 to 15 minutes. Three rules.

[BODY]
One: caffeine only before noon. Two: control your light. Blue light from screens blocks melatonin—your body thinks it's morning. Get blue-light-free bulbs for evening. They feel like candlelight. Three: lower your body temperature. A fan, AC, or a shower about two hours before bed.

[CLOSE]
Cut caffeine early. Dim the lights. Cool down. Sleep follows.
