[HOOK]
See, there are certain things you can do, certain routines or outfits you can put on, that will essentially trick you into entering a certain state of mind. What I like to call the showtime trick.

[BODY]
Almost like an actor putting on a costume before getting ready to perform in front of the camera, or an athlete doing a special ritual before their game. For example, LeBron James will throw some chalk dust up in the air before playing ball. All of these unique rituals are essentially ways for us to trick our mind into putting our game face on. It's a way for us to tell our brain and body: hey, it's show time. It's time for us to act a certain way and give it your all. None of us are born with these rituals—you have to build an association in your mind, almost like how you would build a habit. Obtaining a ritual for the showtime trick can actually be very simple. All you need to do is purposely go out of your way to create a new ritual and make sure that you do something special immediately after the first three times.
