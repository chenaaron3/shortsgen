You're not going to be successful in life if you become a slave of these technologies, a slave of these machines. Now the question is: how does one take back control and make these machines into your slaves instead of the other way around?

[BODY]
There's basically three things that you can do. Strategy number one is to fight fire with fire. I've been using an extension for many, many years now called News Feed Eradicator and it completely eliminates the news feed from my Facebook page. There are apps like this for Instagram, Twitter, and even YouTube. Strategy number two is to manipulate your physical environment. I found that working at home is near impossible because that's where I tend to relax. So what I've done instead is manipulate my physical environment by going outside and working in random cafes. And finally, strategy number three: training yourself like a dog. And a great way to do this is to work for a bit and then purposely reward yourself for a short period of time, sort of like how you would give a dog a treat after he does a trick.
