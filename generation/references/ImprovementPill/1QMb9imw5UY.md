I want to go over the most common forms of meditation: how each of them work, what benefits each bring, and also who each of them are for. Next up on our list is pranayama meditation, also known as breath control meditation.

[BODY]
How does it work? This form of meditation is more about controlling the pacing of your breathing. It is actually often taught as a breathing exercise in the form of the 4-4-4-4 box method. Basically you breathe in through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath for four seconds, exhale slowly for four seconds, and then wait for four seconds. And then you repeat the entire process over and over again. What are the benefits to this? This form of meditation is most widely known for its calming benefits. Studies have shown that it lowers your blood pressure, reduces stress, and even helps you fall asleep. It is also one of the only forms of meditation that have been shown to strengthen your lungs. Who is this for? This is a good form of meditation to practice if you suffer from a lot of stress or anxiety.
