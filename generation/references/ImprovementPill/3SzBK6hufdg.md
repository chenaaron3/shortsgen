[HOOK]
So today I'm going to show you a sort of note-taking mini habit that I created over the years that has allowed me to retain most of the key lessons from the books that I listen to. The note-taking mini habit is essentially this.

[BODY]
See, I carry these little waterproof notebooks with me. And whenever I'm listening to a book and I come across an aha moment—basically a moment where the gears in your head click and something just makes a whole lot of sense to you—when that happens, I will put in some effort to record that lesson down. For example, a couple of weeks ago I was listening to Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins at the gym and I came across an aha moment when he talked about what he likes to call the cookie jar method. So I put down my weights, I paused the audiobook, I pulled out my little notebook and pen, and I wrote down "cookie jar method" and I proceeded to write a short little summary about what it was. And after doing that, I rewinded the audio by a couple of minutes just so I could listen to that part again. If you take a look at this incident, I'm putting in maybe 10, 20 times more effort into digesting this one piece of information. And because of that, that lesson has stuck with me ever since.
