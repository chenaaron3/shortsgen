Recently I made some simple changes to my daily routine which allowed me to double my productivity. And I was able to do this by implementing five simple, proven tricks for getting more done. Part two. Remove distractions before they can come up.

[BODY]
See, the thing is even if you use my advice and you go to a new location, there are still things that you might bring with you that are associated with past distractions. Let's move on to my fourth trick, which is to allow yourself to win easily. See, oftentimes when we tell ourselves that we need to get a lot done, we will set this bar way too high. So the thing you have to understand about productivity is that it's mostly a mental battle. If you believe something is too hard, then you will naturally come up with excuses to avoid even trying. Which is why you got to allow yourself to win easier. Lower your bar for success because then you can hit it more often. My final trick is to reward yourself. If you do not reward yourself, your brain will have no incentive to remember this behavior and it will never become a habit.
