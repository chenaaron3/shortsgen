Today I want to go over the top three ways you can boost your testosterone. The first way you can increase your testosterone is to make sure that you are sleeping properly.

[BODY]
The majority of your testosterone is produced during the REM stage of sleep. This means that anything that interferes with your sleep can negatively impact your levels. The second best way to increase your testosterone is to work out. A study conducted in 1983 found that testosterone levels of men increased by 21% right after a workout. The best thing to do is to lift heavy weights using compound exercises. This includes exercises like squats and bench press. And finally, a study was conducted by the University of Queensland in 2010. They sent researchers to a skatepark to interview and record 96 male skateboarders doing tricks. Afterwards they took saliva samples to measure their testosterone levels. The study found that skateboarders who were being filmed by female researchers had a whopping 30% higher level of testosterone than those who were being filmed by male researchers. Which suggests that being around and performing in front of potential mates drastically increases your testosterone levels.
