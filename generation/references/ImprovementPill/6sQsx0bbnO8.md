So recently I made some simple changes to my daily routine which allowed me to double my productivity. And I was able to do this by implementing five simple, proven tricks for getting more done. Part one: our first trick is all about finding an exclusive location for your work.

[BODY]
And ideally you want to select a location where you haven't made any other pre-existing connections. I was able to implement this trick by moving my work location to a local cafe. The second trick I used to double my productivity: don't give yourself time to think. Procrastination is an emotional problem, right? The more you think about how much you have to do, the worse you start to feel. Which means that you're less likely to actually go and do it. And you can prevent this from happening by taking quick action. All I think about when I wake up is: okay, I need to get dressed and visit the cafe. That's it. And by doing this I can trick myself to take quick action so that I'll go to my exclusive location so that my habit of working there can kick in.
