[HOOK]
Back when I first started going on dates, I would get extremely nervous. So I created a ritual in order to calm my nerves down.

[BODY]
I would meditate and try to be as present as possible during the entire 30- to 45-minute train or bus ride to the date spot. And when I finally got to my stop, I would go out of my way to have three short but fun interactions with some strangers around me. This helped me out a lot because I knew that talking to strangers made me less nervous. And also since these interactions were almost always positive, I would be in a good mood before the date even started. Then after the ritual is over, I made sure that I was as fun and present as possible during the date itself. And after doing this just three times, it became a ritual that I would do before every first date. I started feeling less and less nervous each time because I knew this ritual of mine would trick me into being more fun and present.
