Today I'm going to show you the top three ways to create more happiness. Part two. Let's talk about the third and final way you can create happiness in your life. I call it becoming one with the muse.

[BODY]
There are a ton of different names for this, but the one that you're probably most familiar with already is what's called entering a flow state. This is when you're engaged in an activity with a hundred percent of your focus. Every action, every movement and thought flows out of you effortlessly. You don't have to think—your body just does. Studies have actually found that when we are in the flow state, our brains flood our system with large quantities of dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin. These are all extremely pleasurable neurotransmitters. So how exactly does one enter the flow state more often? Well, it's quite simple. You probably already have a couple of things that you enjoy doing. It can be any hobby, any sort of work or skill, so long as it allows you to be creative in some way. And you just have to make a habit of spending some time every single day playing around with this activity that you enjoy.
