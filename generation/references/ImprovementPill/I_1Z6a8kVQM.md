If you can follow the instructions here, you should eventually be able to fall asleep within 10 to 15 minutes of going to bed.

[BODY]
First, you must limit your caffeine consumption and only drink caffeinated products before noon. The second thing you have to do in order to fall asleep easily is to control your lighting. When blue light—which is the same bright white light that's emitted from most of our devices—reaches our eyes, it prevents our bodies from producing melatonin. It's basically tricking our body into thinking that it's still the morning. There are certain light bulbs that you can get that are blue light free. The light they produce feels similar to the lighting of candles and this will help your body produce more melatonin in the evening. Now, the third and final thing you have to do to fall asleep easily is to lower your body temperature. You can turn on a fan or an air conditioner which will help lower your body temperature. Or if you don't want to use so much electricity, you can opt to take a shower in the evening. The ideal time to take a shower is around two hours before you plan on heading to bed.
