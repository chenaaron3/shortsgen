[HOOK]
How do we adopt an internal locus of control so that we can start feeling motivated all of the time? Well, they found that the best way to do so is by simply solving problems in your own life and then taking some time and appreciating the fact that it was your actions that solved this problem.

[BODY]
I'll give you an example just to make things more clear. Let's say you're someone who struggles with falling asleep. So you go do some research and you find out: if you get some more sunlight in the morning, if you only use your bed for sleeping, and if you install a blue light filter on your phone, that should drastically increase your ability to sleep faster. When bedtime comes around, you do all of those things and lo and behold you find yourself sleeping 15 minutes faster than before. When you notice this improvement, you need to say to yourself: wow, it was because of the changes I made, because of the effort I put in, that I am now able to sleep better.

[CLOSE]
It's that simple. Build up that belief that you are in control of your destiny, that you have an internal locus of control, and you will never have issues with motivation in your life again.
