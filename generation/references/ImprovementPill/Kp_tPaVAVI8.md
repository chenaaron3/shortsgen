Today I'm going to go over the top three careers that are currently in high demand, do not require a college degree, can often be done remotely, have good starting pay, and have the potential to be good long-term careers.

[BODY]
The first career on my list is technology sales, also known as business development or sales development. Instead of selling small items and services to average Joes, technology sales focuses on selling software and tech to businesses. And this career path has a much higher ceiling in terms of growth. It's a path that many CEOs of companies have taken before in the past. The second type of career on our list is IT—it is a term that covers a wide variety of support positions in the digital world. If you take a look at this image here you'll see the many potential paths of this career. The majority of these later positions are high paying with salaries ranging from 100 to 300,000. The third career path on our list is called digital marketing. Digital marketing, simply put, is helping companies with their online marketing efforts. The average starting salary can range anywhere from forty to fifty thousand dollars entry level.
