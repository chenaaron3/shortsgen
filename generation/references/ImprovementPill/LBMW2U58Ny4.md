Today I'm going to show you the top three ways to create more happiness. Part one. The first way to create more happiness is by fixing the ratio.

[BODY]
Studies have found that about 80 percent of the thoughts that we have on a day-to-day basis are negative. This is bad because every time you have a negative thought it comes with a negative feeling. On the other hand, when you have a positive thought—like "people love me"—what does that do? Well, it makes you feel good, right? These type of thoughts do the opposite; they create happiness. Which is why if you want to be happy, you need to fix the ratio of the amount of bad thoughts you have every day to the amount of good thoughts you have every day. The next way we can create more happiness in our lives is by building and maintaining social bonds. See, almost all human beings have a built-in need for social bonds. It's in our DNA. You actually have to have them or else your brain will shrink and there's a pretty good chance that you'll develop some form of mental illness. When you have conversations with people, it's a form of play. You can exchange information, you can solve problems together. These activities create happiness within us.
