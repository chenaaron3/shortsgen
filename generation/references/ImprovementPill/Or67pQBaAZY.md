[HOOK]
We all want to be happy, but the majority of us have no idea what to do. See, the Japanese have a concept called ikigai, which roughly translates into a reason for being. You need to have a purpose for being here. But this is easier said than done because there are four components that you need to check off in order to achieve ikigai. The fourth and final component is that it needs to be something that you're good at.

[BODY]
Now this doesn't mean that you need to be born with talent. This actually means that you're able to put in the time and effort in order to get better at this skill. Let's say for example you want to become a motivational speaker. When you first get started you're terrible—you have stage fright, you stutter a lot, you forget what you're supposed to say. But over time as you practice more and more, you start to overcome these obstacles. That's what it means to be good at something. Not to be good from the get-go, but to be able to overcome obstacles and improve at this skill. This overcoming of obstacles creates a very fulfilling feeling inside of you, which is why it's such a crucial component of ikigai.
