[HOOK]
I never cared much about investing, so I was sitting on cash that I had saved up from working on this business for the past five years. And I realized that I should figure out what to do with this money because, as many great investors say, when there's blood on the street, that's the best time to buy.

[BODY]
I ended up spending three to four hours every single day just devouring all the finance and econ material that I could get my hands on. I remember binge listening to an eight-hour-long book on the history of money in one sitting. And what's funny is that this was basically the same material that I was studying back in college. But this time around I was able to do it effortlessly. My motivation was so high that I didn't even have to try. How is this possible? Well, it all comes down to a concept that I've recently been digging into called Wu Wei. Wu Wei is an ancient Chinese philosophy which directly translates into the art of doing nothing or the art of non-forcing. Now this doesn't actually mean that you should do nothing. Wu Wei is more about aligning your life in a way so that things feel effortless.
