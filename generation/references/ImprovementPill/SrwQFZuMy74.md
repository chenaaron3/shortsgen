Today I'm going to show you exactly how you can get people to open up to you. Part two. Most of the time people just won't talk about things that they've been bottling up for months or even years unless you prompt them to. Which is why the second thing you have to do is ask the right questions.

[BODY]
And not just any question—they're what I like to call assumption questions. All it is is when you make an assumption about someone based on an observation and see if it's true or not. It shows that you are really, really listening. Because the only way you can make an assumption like this is if you are paying a hundred percent close attention to what they were saying, how they were saying it, and their body language. The second thing this does is it causes them to react. If your assumption is wrong, they will instinctively want to correct you. But what I've found is that if you're really paying attention, you'll actually be able to make a correct assumption most of the time. And when that happens—when your assumption is correct—they will almost always start opening up. And that's how you get someone to open up: by reducing your filter and asking assumption questions.
