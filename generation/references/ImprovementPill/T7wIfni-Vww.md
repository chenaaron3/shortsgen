I want to go over the most common forms of meditation: how each of them work, what benefits each bring, and also who each of them are for. We will start off with mindfulness breathing meditation.

[BODY]
How does it work? Well, basically you focus on the sensation of breathing—the feeling of air going in your nose and out your mouth. And whenever a thought appears, you simply notice it, let it float away, and then you bring your attention back to your breathing. What sort of benefits does this form of meditation bring? Now, mindfulness breathing meditation falls under the scientific category of what's called open awareness meditations, where you focus on becoming aware of your thoughts and feelings. These forms of meditation have been shown to drastically increase your levels of creativity, allowing you to come up with many different ideas and solutions to problems. If you want to gain more control over how sensitive you are to negative thoughts and also how creative you are, then this might be the best form of meditation for you.
