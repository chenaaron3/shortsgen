I want to go over the most common forms of meditation: how each of them work, what benefits each bring, and also who each of them are for. The next formal meditation on our list is mantra meditation.

[BODY]
How does it work? Mantra meditation is a special form of meditation where you focus on repeating a phrase or a series of words over and over again. The best mantras are positively phrased. For example, "I am calm" is a better mantra to repeat than "I do not worry." What are the benefits to this? The benefits really depend on which mantra you choose. When you repeat a phrase to yourself so many times and focus on it with such intensity, you start to believe it in a way. Mantra meditation can reprogram the way you think and view yourself. Who is this for? Mantra meditation is for anyone who feels like they have a certain belief about themselves or about life that is holding them back, because it allows you to pinpoint a specific problem that you have and fix it.
