[HOOK]
We all want to be happy, but the majority of us have no idea what to do. See, the Japanese have a concept called ikigai, which roughly translates into a reason for being. You need to have a purpose for being here. But this is easier said than done because there are four components that you need to check off in order to achieve ikigai. The third component for ikigai is that it needs to be something that you can get paid well for.

[BODY]
Some of you are automatically going to say something like: oh, Improvement Pill, you don't need money in order to be happy. But let's be real. Money is what puts a roof over your head, food in your mouth, and clothes on your body. Without enough of it, you're gonna spend the majority of your time stressed out of your mind wondering how you're going to get by. And it's not enough to just be making some money. You need to be getting paid well enough to live a comfortable life. If you're not making enough money to live without stress, then you will never achieve happiness.
