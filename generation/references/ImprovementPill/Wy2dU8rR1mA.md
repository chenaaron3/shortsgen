[HOOK]
We all want to be happy, but the majority of us have no idea what to do. See, the Japanese have a concept called ikigai, which roughly translates into a reason for being. You need to have a purpose for being here. But this is easier said than done because there are four components that you need to check off in order to achieve ikigai. The second component for ikigai needs to be something that the world needs.

[BODY]
See, we've been hardwired to feel good when we know that we're needed in a community. Back in the day when we were hunters and gatherers, this was easy. Everyone played an important part. The cook was just as important as the hunter. Back then, whenever you put in work, you could see the immediate positive effects your efforts had on others. But this isn't the case nowadays. Most of us work in offices, being given small roles in a massive company. Where even if we work our butts off, it's hard to see the positive effects our work has on the rest of the world. It feels like our work isn't really helping anyone. You need to find something that the world needs—something that you can do that will create a visible positive effect on those around you.
