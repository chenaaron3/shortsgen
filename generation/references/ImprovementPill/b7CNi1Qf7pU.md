I want to go over the most common forms of meditation: how each of them work, what benefits each bring, and also who each of them are for. Next up we got focused attention meditation.

[BODY]
How does it work? Well, technically focused attention meditation involves any sort of meditation where you focus on a particular stimulus of any kind. It can be sound, a sensation in your body, or even something visual like an object. What are the benefits to this? Researchers have actually discovered that focused attention meditation activates and strengthens a part of the brain—the anterior cingulate cortex. This is the part of our brain used for detecting errors, overcoming impulses, and solving problems. Which suggests that practicing this form of meditation will help improve all three of those things. This form of meditation is perfect for those of you that are looking to use meditation to excel in school or in your career, as it trains your brain to find solutions to problems more effectively.
