Today I want to share with you one of the only feasible methods that I know of for escaping the rat race. Part one. Step number one: understand that the system is broken.

[BODY]
It is virtually impossible for you to simply work hard, reduce your costs, and save your way out of the rat race. Step number two: increase your income stream. The more money you have, the more money you can potentially make. If this means that you need to stay at your current job, that's fine. Because right now in this current economy, more important than ever, you need that stream of income to keep coming in. And the larger the stream is, the better, as it will give you more chances to actually make it out of the rat race. Step number three: take asymmetrical bets. An asymmetrical bet is a bet that has limited downside with almost unlimited upside. Which basically means that it's a bet that has a decent chance of paying off extraordinarily high returns. The key part here is a decent chance of paying off.
