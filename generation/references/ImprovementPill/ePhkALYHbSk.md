I want to go over the most common forms of meditation: how each of them work, what benefits each bring, and also who each of them are for. The next form of meditation on our list is guided meditation.

[BODY]
How does it work? Well, basically this is any form of meditation where a narrator is guiding you through the process. You simply follow their instructions and that's basically it. The meditation sessions can vary greatly depending on the video or app that you're using. What sort of benefits does this form of meditation bring? I would definitely say that this form of meditation is the easiest form. And that's because you don't really have to deal with complete silence and the doubts that come when practicing meditation by yourself. Who is this form of meditation for? Guided meditation is something you should consider if you've tried other forms of meditation but felt like it was too difficult. There's no harm in putting on some training wheels and getting used to sitting still for extended periods of time before eventually moving on to more advanced forms of meditation.
