[HOOK]
Asking out your crush is best done with a simple three-step process. Step number one is to get their attention.

[BODY]
You can do this by either going up to them in real life or by starting a conversation using the internet. Once you have their attention, you can then move on to step number two, which is to say something along the lines of: hey, I like you, let's go on a date at blank place at blank time. And finally, step number three: you look them in the eye if applicable, don't say anything, and you simply wait for an answer. And it's always going to be just one of the following three things: A, they say yes—in which case congratulations; B, they give you any excuse as to why they can't go; C, which is a flat out no. And if they reject you, embrace the pain and use it to transform yourself. Pain is good. Pain lights a fire within you so you start taking action. Pain is what ultimately makes you sexy.
