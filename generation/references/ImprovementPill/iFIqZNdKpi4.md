These are studying tips that you probably haven't heard of. Some of them are going to sound strange, but I think it's worth a shot to try these out and see if they work for you.

The first tip is to use certain sounds to increase your focus and learning. Huberman recommends using 40 Hz either 5 minutes before a study session or even during it to help you focus. The second tip is called overt visual focus. All you have to do is stare at something for 30 seconds—it could be a dot on the wall, a water bottle on your desk, your plant across the room. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as you are maintaining your focus on that specific spot. The last tip we're going to go over today is in regards to improving your memory so that you actually remember what you study. And there's basically two ways to go about doing this: the first is through repetition, the second way is through intensity. Studies have found a direct correlation between adrenaline and the formation of memories. How do we take advantage of this in a healthy way? Well, the key according to studies is to spike adrenaline right after you learn. You can naturally pump your adrenaline by jumping in a cold shower.
