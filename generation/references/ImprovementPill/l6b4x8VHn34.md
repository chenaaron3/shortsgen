[HOOK]
A psychologist walked into a room while teaching stress management to an audience. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected that they'd be asked: is this glass half empty or half full? But instead, with a smile on her face, she asked: how heavy do you think this glass of water is?

[BODY]
People called out: eight ounces, 16 ounces, 20 ounces. And she replied: the weight of this glass doesn't matter. It all depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for just a minute, it's not a problem. The glass still feels light. But if I hold it for an entire day, my arm would start to feel numb and paralyzed. The glass would feel unbearable. The weight of the glass never changes, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes. See, the stresses and worries in life are like a glass of water. If you think about them for just a while, nothing happens. If you think about them for a bit longer, they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, then you will feel paralyzed, incapable of doing anything.

[CLOSE]
So remember to put the glass down. —Jimmy Harmon
