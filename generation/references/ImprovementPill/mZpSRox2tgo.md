I want to go over the most common forms of meditation: how each of them work, what benefits each bring, and also who each of them are for. And finally we have moving meditation.

[BODY]
How does it work? Well, moving meditation is done when you are completely focused on making some sort of movement—whether it's walking, doing chores, yoga, or even dancing. While you move, you focus on the physical changes and sensations that occur. For example, if you choose to practice moving meditation while walking, your focus will be on the feeling of your feet touching the ground and pushing off, and so on. What are the benefits to this? I believe that the main benefits of moving meditation is that it teaches you how to enter the flow state. This is because certain movements such as dance force you to be creative and present at the same time. Who is this for? This form of meditation is great if you have a hard time sitting still. Maybe you have some health issues that prevent you from doing so, or maybe you feel too jittery.
