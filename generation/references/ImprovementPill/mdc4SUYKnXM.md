I figured out a way to hack Parkinson's Law. Parkinson's Law states that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. Which basically means the amount of time you think you have to complete something is how long it will take you to complete that thing.

[BODY]
So if you have a project due in three months, you'll probably end up taking three months to finish it. Well, it's more like you'll do almost nothing for two and a half months and then cram it all in during the last couple of weeks. The same thing can be applied to all your dreams and ambitions in life. See, I've always been a pretty paranoid person—to the point where every time I go on a plane I vividly imagine it crashing. The fact that I will die does not make me cower in a corner somewhere. I understand that it's unavoidable, which makes me want to experience as much of the world as possible before my time is up. And because I feel like I don't have much time left, it causes me to take action every single day.

That's how you max out Parkinson's Law. Follow us for more helpful tips.
