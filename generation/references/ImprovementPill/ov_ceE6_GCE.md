[HOOK]
Today I want to reveal to you the secret to getting better at talking to people. So the first thing you have to understand is that you were not born socially handicapped.

[BODY]
We humans are a very social species. So much in fact that you can take a baby and put him or her in a room full of people and over time he or she will learn to speak purely through observation. And this is because the human brain is actually extremely good at identifying patterns and rules when it comes to social interactions. The reason your social skills aren't that great is simply because you haven't given your brain enough time to observe interactions and become fluent in all of the patterns and rules. In short, you lack practice. The secret to getting better at talking to people or learning any language is to simply get more practice—to interact with more people, to give your brain more opportunities to observe and learn the unique patterns and rules of this language.

[CLOSE]
So just go out there and start talking to more people. That's the secret.
