[HOOK]
The secret to believing in yourself. Step number one: figure out what you currently say to yourself.

[BODY]
You need to pay attention to what goes on in your head throughout the day and look for the most common negative thoughts. Step number two: figure out what new thoughts you want to adopt. Look at your list of negative thoughts and figure out the opposite of those statements. For example, "I am weak" becomes "I am strong." Step number three: find proof for your new thoughts. Let's say for example you've never worked out before. In this case, simply doing a 30-minute workout routine is proof that you are stronger. Step number four: repeat your new thoughts every time you find proof. So using the example from before, after doing your workout routine, think to yourself: I am mentally strong. Step number five: repeat steps three and four until your new thoughts become your normal thoughts. Basically just keep gathering proof and keep repeating your new thoughts to yourself. Nothing fancy, just rinse and repeat.
