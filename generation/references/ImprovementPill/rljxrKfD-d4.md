[HOOK]
I want to go over the most common forms of meditation: how each of them work, what benefits each bring, and also who each of them are for. The next form of meditation on our list is metta meditation, also known as loving kindness meditation.

[BODY]
When you practice metta meditation, your goal is to send love in several directions. You start off by visualizing and sending love towards yourself by repeating a predetermined phrase like "may I be happy." After a while you do the same thing to a friend, then to a stranger, then to someone you dislike, and finally to the universe as a whole. What sort of benefits does this form of meditation bring? Well, loving kindness meditation is well known for increasing empathy towards other people. It has also been shown to reduce pain, reduce negative emotions, and even help with PTSD. Who is this form of meditation for? Metta meditation is good if you feel like you have a lot of hate or anger within you, whether it's guided towards yourself or other people.
