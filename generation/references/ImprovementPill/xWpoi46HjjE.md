Today I'm going to show you exactly how you can get people to open up to you. Part one. First you have to learn to reduce your filter.

[BODY]
If you think about it, the reason why we are scared to say certain things or to act in certain ways is because we are afraid of how others will react. Instead of talking about things that we really want to talk about, we put on a filter and we spend most of our time conversing in small talk. But secretly, deep down inside, we're all looking for someone who we can share our strange thoughts and ideas with. Now if you come along and you show them from the start that you don't really care about being a perfect snowflake, that you don't really filter yourself, and that you are willing to talk about things that are deemed as socially unacceptable or strange, then people will want to open up to you. Now it's very important to note that there is a fine line between being seen as someone who has a reduced filter and being seen as someone who is just plain old crazy. And it all depends on your perceived value. If your value is too low, people will just think that you're crazy.
