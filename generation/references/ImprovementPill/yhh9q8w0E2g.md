[HOOK]
We all want to be happy, but the majority of us have no idea what to do. See, the Japanese have a concept called ikigai, which roughly translates into a reason for being. You need to have a purpose for being here. But this is easier said than done because there are four components that you need to check off in order to achieve ikigai. The first component is that it needs to be something that you love.

[BODY]
We all have things that make us feel good, things that make us stop thinking for short periods of time to just be present and aware of what's happening right now in front of us. The more technical people will call this flow state, but the majority of us call it love. That's why so many of us enjoy the arts—drawing, dancing, singing, reading—because it takes us into the state of bliss where we feel good and are focused on the task in front of us. That's why some of us fall in love with one another—because being with that person allows us to forget about all the other problems in our lives, at least momentarily. I don't need to get into too much detail about this component because we know in our gut when we truly love to do something. It's a feeling that we humans all share.
