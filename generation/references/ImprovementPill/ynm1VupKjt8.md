Today I want to share with you one of the only feasible methods that I know of for escaping the rat race. Part two. Step number four: the three R's—risk management, rinse and repeat.

[BODY]
Never ever bet more than you can afford to lose. Don't borrow money, don't sell the house, don't go all in on a bet because you could be wrong. Only bet what you can afford to lose so that you can survive to bet again. Which is the rinse and repeat part. Step number five: diversify and chill out. If you ever hit the jackpot with an asymmetrical bet, you should have life-changing money on your hands. Then you should focus your time on figuring out how to preserve your wealth. As you'll be in a position where making sure your money is well managed will probably make you more money than your old job would have. I know all of this sounds risky, which is why again you should speak with your financial advisor before doing anything with your money.
