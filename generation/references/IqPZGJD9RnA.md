```
[HOOK]
What if your biggest weakness is actually your hidden strength?

[BODY]
Think about it: Confidence can turn into arrogance in the wrong setting. But flip it, and shyness might just be reflection. The same trait can be a strength or a weakness, depending on the context. So when we label others—or even ourselves—as strong or weak, we're missing the bigger picture.

[CLOSE]
Instead of labeling, nurture your relationships. When storms hit, you'll need people who say, "I've got your back." That's where true strength lies.
