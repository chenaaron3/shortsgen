[HOOK]
Imagine facing a gun and walking away with a scar... and a new purpose.

[BODY]
One day, a man had a 45-caliber pistol shoved into his face. The scar is still there—a reminder of that moment. After 76 stitches and a hospital stay, he found himself in a treatment center 28 days later. But something shifted. It wasn’t just about quitting drugs. It was about starting fresh.

[CLOSE]
Sometimes, a near-death experience can become a new beginning. Next time you feel stuck, remember: you can always start becoming someone new.
