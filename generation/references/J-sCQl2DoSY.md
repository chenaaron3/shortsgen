[HOOK]
What if your identity is holding you back?

[BODY]
Life will throw challenges your way, no doubt. But here's a secret: your identity doesn't have to be one of them. Many people cling to labels—"I'm an author," "I'm a leader"—and mold their lives around them. But what if you're more than that? What if being flexible with your identity is the key to growth?

[CLOSE]
Next time you feel boxed in by a label, ask yourself: "Is this who I am, or just what I do right now?"
