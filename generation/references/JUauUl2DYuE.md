[HOOK]
Want to know why Jeff Bezos and Fred Smith are unstoppable?

[BODY]
They didn’t invent anything groundbreaking. Bezos started by selling books. Smith used airplanes and delivery trucks. What sets them apart is their ability to combine the ordinary in extraordinary ways. It’s not about discovering a new molecule; it's about reimagining what already exists.

[CLOSE]
Look at the tools around you. How can you combine them in a way no one else has thought of?
