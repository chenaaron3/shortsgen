```
[HOOK]
You feel empty, like you've got nothing left. But you're wrong.

[BODY]
Imagine running on fumes, convinced you're out of fuel. Yet, there's half a tank left. That's enough to reach your destination. Pain may make you pause, but it's not a stop sign. Without pain and sacrifice, there's no growth, no reward. 

[CLOSE]
When you're at your limit, remember: keep grinding. Push through the discomfort. On the other side, something great is waiting. Don't give up now.
