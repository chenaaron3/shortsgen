[HOOK]
You can feel motivated all the time. Here's how.

[BODY]
Adopt an internal locus of control. Studies found the best way: solve a problem in your life, then pause and appreciate that your actions fixed it. Example: you struggle with sleep. You try morning sunlight, a blue-light filter, and using your bed only for sleep. You start falling asleep 15 minutes faster. When you notice—say to yourself: I did that. My choices made the difference.

[CLOSE]
Build that belief. You are in control of your destiny. Motivation follows.
