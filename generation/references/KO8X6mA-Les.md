[HOOK]
Studying for hours but getting no results? Most students fail for one reason.

[BODY]
They study without a plan. Studying without a plan is like driving without a destination. You move but never arrive. Top students don't study longer—they study smarter. They write clear tasks: finish chapter 5, math problems. Not just "study math." Clear goals equal clear focus. Plan your day and watch your grades change.

[CLOSE]
This is just one habit. Master all five and transform your results.
