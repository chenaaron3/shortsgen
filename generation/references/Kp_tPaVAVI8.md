[HOOK]
Three high-demand careers. No degree required. Often remote.

[BODY]
First: technology sales. Selling software to businesses—not trinkets to individuals. CEOs have taken this path. Second: IT support. A wide umbrella of digital roles. Salaries in later positions range from 100K to 300K. Third: digital marketing. Helping companies with online presence. Starting pay: forty to fifty thousand.

[CLOSE]
Pick one. Learn it. The ceiling is higher than you think.
