[HOOK]
Eighty percent of our daily thoughts are negative. That's the problem.

[BODY]
Every negative thought brings a negative feeling. Positive thoughts do the opposite—they create happiness. Fix the ratio. More good thoughts than bad. Second: build social bonds. We're hardwired for connection. Without it, your brain can shrink. Conversations are a form of play. You exchange ideas. You solve problems together. That creates happiness.

[CLOSE]
Notice your thoughts. Fix the ratio. Invest in people who matter.
