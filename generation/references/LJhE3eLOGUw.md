[HOOK]
Winning isn't always the end. Sometimes, it's the beginning of a downfall.

[BODY]
Imagine reaching the peak of success—like winning an Oscar.
You've climbed the Mountaintop.
But what's next? Darkness can follow.
Many winners face an unexpected fear—they might not work again.
It's an algorithm of achievement: win big, then stumble if you don't shake it off.

[CLOSE]
Celebrate success, but stay ready. When you reach the top, prepare for what comes next.
