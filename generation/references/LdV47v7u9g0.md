```
[HOOK]
Want to know your future? Look at your friends.

[BODY]
Ever wonder why families like the Kennedys or Rockefellers send their kids to elite schools? It's not just the education. It's the environment. When you're surrounded by wealth creation and high performance, it rubs off on you. It's expected. It's the norm. And that expectation shapes who you become.

[CLOSE]
Choose friends who lift you higher. Their habits will become yours.
