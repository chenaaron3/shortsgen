[HOOK]
Ever wonder why some thrive in tough times while others crumble?

[BODY]
Think about the cycle: Good times make people weak. Weak people create bad times. Yet, bad times forge strong individuals. And those strong people? They create great times. Here's the kicker: Over 60% of Fortune 1,000 companies were born in economic "winters"—recessions and depressions. Disney thrived during the Great Depression. FedEx took off in a recession. These companies didn't just survive—they leveraged the tough times.

[CLOSE]
Next time you face a challenge, remember: It's your opportunity to grow stronger. Find that part inside you that refuses to give up.
