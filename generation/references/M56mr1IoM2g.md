[HOOK]
What if chasing success is the wrong path?

[BODY]
Imagine the pressure to meet others' definitions of success. Achievements that look good on paper. But one person made a different choice. To focus on character, not just success. They planned, decided, and pursued what truly mattered. And something unexpected happened.

[CLOSE]
Choose character over success, and watch how success starts chasing you.
