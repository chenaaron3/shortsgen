[HOOK]
Even if you could snap your fingers and be anywhere, you'd still feel out of place.

[BODY]
Imagine you're exactly where you want to be overnight. But something feels off. You're still not satisfied. That's because the problem isn't location—it's mindset. We get so focused on where we'd rather be that we miss out on what's right in front of us.

[CLOSE]
Take a break from chasing what's out of reach. Live a little where you are now.
