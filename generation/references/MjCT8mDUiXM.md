```
[HOOK]
The words you use can change your future.

[BODY]
Saying "I can't do it" shuts the door. It stops you before you even start.
But switch it to "I haven't done it yet," and suddenly the door opens.
Now, it's not about ability; it's about time and practice.
You haven't done it yet—key word, "yet."

[CLOSE]
Next time you're faced with a challenge, add "yet" to your thoughts. Watch what happens.
