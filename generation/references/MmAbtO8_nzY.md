[HOOK]
Most people aim for mediocrity. But here's the twist.

[BODY]
99% of people think they can't achieve greatness. So, they settle for realistic goals. This is where competition is the toughest—everyone fights for the average. But here's the secret: if you're insecure, remember, so is everyone else. You're not competing against giants.

[CLOSE]
Don't underestimate yourself. Aim higher. You're more capable than you think.
