[HOOK]
Ever feel like you're misunderstood until you succeed?

[BODY]
People will call you crazy for chasing your dreams. They say, "Be realistic." But once you make it, suddenly you're a genius. It's like everyone loves your drive—after the fact. Why the change? Because greatness often comes from those who endure more suffering than most. It's about expressing your unique experiences, finding your purpose. 

[CLOSE]
When doubt creeps in, remember: Your journey is yours. Keep going. They'll see it when you've made it.
