[HOOK]
Want to know the secret to success? It's not what you think.

[BODY]
Imagine the first person who truly succeeded, maybe back in 1900. Picture him in funny clothes. He wasn't a superhero, just a person like you. The key? Study his journey. Read everything he did. Discover his methods. They weren't magic—just actions you can take.

[CLOSE]
Dive into their stories. Practice what they practiced. Success leaves clues. Follow them.
