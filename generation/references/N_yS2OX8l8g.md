[HOOK]
What if life was only green lights?

[BODY]
Imagine cruising through life without a single stop. No pauses, no hardships, no moments of crisis. Just endless green lights. Sounds perfect, right? But without those yellow and red lights, we'd never grow. We'd remain unchanged, stuck in the same mindset. Those pauses, those challenges, are what push us to evolve.

[CLOSE]
Next time you hit a red light in life, remember—it's your chance to grow. Embrace it.
