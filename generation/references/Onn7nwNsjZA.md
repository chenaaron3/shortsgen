[HOOK]
Courage isn't the absence of fear. So what is it?

[BODY]
Fear grips you in the throat or churns in your gut. That's physical. But so is courage. It's not about being fearless—it's about feeling the fear and choosing to push through it. When you push beyond your comfort zone, you tap into an inner strength.

[CLOSE]
Embrace that strength. Use it to transform your body, emotions, and relationships. Feel the fear—and push anyway.
