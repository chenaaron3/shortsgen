[HOOK]
The fourth component of ikigai: it has to be something you're good at.

[BODY]
Not born-with talent. You're able to put in time and effort to get better. Example: you want to be a motivational speaker. At first you're terrible—stage fright, stuttering, forgetting your lines. Over time you practice. You overcome. That's what "good at" means. The overcoming creates a fulfilling feeling inside. That's why it's crucial to ikigai.

[CLOSE]
Pick something you can improve at. The growth itself becomes the reward.
