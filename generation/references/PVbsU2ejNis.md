```
[HOOK]
The company you keep might be holding you back more than you think.

[BODY]
Instead of discussing your future, you're caught up listening to gossip.
You're around people who aren't moving forward.
You're tuning into music that talks about negativity.
These choices shape your mindset and your future in ways you might not realize.

[CLOSE]
Surround yourself with those who inspire growth. Choose influences that talk about life and possibility, not setbacks and limitations.
