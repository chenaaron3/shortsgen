[HOOK]
I studied the same material in college and hated it. Years later, I devoured it effortlessly.

[BODY]
The difference: Wu Wei. An ancient Chinese concept—the art of non-forcing. It doesn't mean do nothing. It means align your life so things feel effortless. When there was blood on the street, I wanted to learn investing. I listened to an eight-hour book in one sitting. Same content as college. But this time, motivation was so high I didn't have to try.

[CLOSE]
Find where your life wants to go. Then stop forcing the opposite direction.
