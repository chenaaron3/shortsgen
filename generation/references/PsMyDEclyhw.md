[HOOK]
Are you living within your limits... or just within your comfort zone?

[BODY]
Your 20s are the perfect time to experiment. Push yourself beyond what feels easy. How many hours can you really work? 12? 8? 3? Test your discipline. Test your endurance. Find the edge of your capabilities. Only then can you know your true potential.

[CLOSE]
Push past your limits—then pull back to what's sustainable. That's where growth happens.
