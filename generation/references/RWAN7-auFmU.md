[HOOK]
Struggling with something new might be your greatest opportunity.

[BODY]
Imagine being great at one thing—only to start at zero again. That's where I found myself in comedy. Sure, I got a few laughs, but I was terrible. Yet, being terrible was exciting. Why? It meant I had room to grow. Growth is slow when you're already great, but when you're at the bottom, the only way is up.

[CLOSE]
Embrace being bad at something new. It means you have the potential to become amazing.
