[HOOK]
You might think your dream is too far-fetched. But here's a secret...

[BODY]
Even if your dream seems impossible, or you've faced disappointment chasing it, there's something important to remember. You don't always have to say, "I can do that." Instead, focus on this: it's possible. 

[CLOSE]
So, hold onto that dream. The first step? Believe in its possibility.
