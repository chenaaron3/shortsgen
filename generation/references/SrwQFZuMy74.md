[HOOK]
People won't open up unless you prompt them. Use assumption questions.

[BODY]
Make an assumption about someone based on what you observed. "It sounds like you've been thinking about this for a while." It proves you're listening—you had to pay close attention to their words, tone, and body language. If you're wrong, they'll correct you. If you're right, they'll almost always start opening up. Reduce your filter. Ask assumption questions.

[CLOSE]
Listen closely. Then reflect back what you noticed. They'll fill in the rest.
