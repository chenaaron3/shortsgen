[HOOK]
Mindfulness breathing meditation can reprogram how you think.

[BODY]
How it works: focus on the feeling of air in your nose and out your mouth. When a thought appears, notice it. Let it float away. Return to the breath. It falls under open awareness meditation. Benefits: creativity spikes. You come up with more ideas and solutions. You gain control over how sensitive you are to negative thoughts.

[CLOSE]
If you want more creativity and less reactivity—start with five minutes of breath focus today.
