```
[HOOK]
Why can't most people truly be themselves?

[BODY]
Most people live in a line—following the person in front of them.
They conform to fit in, to blend with the crowd.
But this life of uniformity hides their true selves.
They prioritize fitting in over being real.

[CLOSE]
Dare to step out of line. Embrace who you are, not who you're told to be.
