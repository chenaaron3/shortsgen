```
[HOOK]
What separates winners from everyone else? It's not talent.

[BODY]
It's hunger. The ability to face defeat, repeatedly, without giving up.
When you're truly hungry, facts and odds don't matter.
You stop asking, "What if I fail?" Instead, you ask, "What risks can I embrace?"
You step on your fears and awaken dead areas of your life.
The choice is simple: live your dreams or live your fears.

[CLOSE]
Decide today: Are you ready to say, "I'm done living like this. There's got to be more"?
