[HOOK]
Courage isn't just about medals and glory.

[BODY]
I once believed courage was winning the Medal of Honor. But life showed me something deeper. True courage is the soldier who laces up his boots every single day. It's about showing up and fighting for something greater, even when no one knows your name or your struggles.

[CLOSE]
Next time you feel unseen, remember: courage is in the quiet battles you fight daily.
