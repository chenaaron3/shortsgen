[HOOK]
Life isn't about how hard you get hit...

[BODY]
It's about getting back up. The world is tough—it'll knock you down. But staying down is your choice. When life punches you, it's easy to blame others, to say, "This is why I can't succeed." But that's not the answer.

[CLOSE]
Next time you stumble, remember: resilience is moving forward, no matter what. Rise up and take that next step.
