[HOOK]
What if talent isn't the secret to success?

[BODY]
Thomas believed he was in control, even when things got tough. His secret? It wasn't talent. He trusted in something he couldn't see—his belief. People often think talent is the key. Sure, it helps. But Thomas knew that determination and willpower trump talent every time.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're doubting yourself, remember: It's not about talent. It's about your will to win.
