[HOOK]
Mantra meditation can reprogram how you think about yourself.

[BODY]
Repeat a phrase over and over. "I am calm" works better than "I do not worry." Positively phrased. When you repeat something with intensity, you start to believe it. Mantra meditation lets you pinpoint a specific belief that holds you back—and fix it. It's for anyone with a self-limiting belief about who they are or what's possible.

[CLOSE]
Pick one phrase that flips a limiting belief. Repeat it. Until it becomes true.
