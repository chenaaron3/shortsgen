[HOOK]
The secret to protecting yourself from harm? Embrace your inner dark side.

[BODY]
Think about Harry Potter. He withstands Voldemort because he's touched by him. Sounds strange, right? But here's the twist: to keep the real-life "villains" at bay, you must recognize the darkness within yourself. It's like having a toolkit of everything you know about evil. This awareness isn't about being bad—it's about seeing and understanding it.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're in a tricky situation, ask yourself: "What does my inner defender see here?"
