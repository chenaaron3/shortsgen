[HOOK]
The third component of ikigai: it has to pay well.

[BODY]
You might say money doesn't buy happiness. But money puts a roof over your head, food in your mouth, clothes on your body. Without enough, you'll spend most of your time stressed—wondering how you'll get by. It's not enough to make some money. You need enough to live without stress. If you're not there, you'll never achieve happiness.

[CLOSE]
Your purpose and your paycheck have to align. Otherwise, stress will block the rest.
