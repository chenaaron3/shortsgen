[HOOK]
Are you only halfway happy with where you are right now?

[BODY]
Imagine being up by 20 points in a game. Most would celebrate early. But not everyone. Some say, "Job's not finished." That mindset separates the good from the great. It's about aiming for first place, not settling for second. And even when it hurts, they show up. Why? Because they remember the fans, the people who believe in them.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're tempted to settle, ask yourself: Is the job really finished?
