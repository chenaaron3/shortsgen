[HOOK]
Want to discover your true potential? Here's the surprising way.

[BODY]
In your 20s, test your limits. How many hours can you work flat out? 12? 8? Only 3? Push until you find where your boundaries truly lie. It's not just about work—consider your social life too. Find the edges of your tolerance.

[CLOSE]
Once you've pushed past, dial it back to a balance you can sustain. That's where growth happens.
