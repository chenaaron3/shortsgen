[HOOK]
The secret to winning? It starts with failure.

[BODY]
Most people avoid failure like the plague. It's terrifying. But here's the twist: to truly win, you must first achieve failure. You have to push yourself to the edge, right where it feels too scary to continue. That's the place where winning begins.

[CLOSE]
Next time you face failure, embrace it. It's not the end—it's your starting line.
