[HOOK]
What if I told you that failure is your greatest teacher?

[BODY]
In school, we're taught that failing means we're not smart enough. But that's a lie. Failure isn't a stop sign; it's a stepping stone. Our education system says, "Memorize the right answers, and you'll be safe." So we grow up thinking knowing is enough. But true growth comes from taking risks, making mistakes, and learning from them.

[CLOSE]
Don't fear failure. Embrace it. Choose jobs for what they teach you, not just what they pay. Each mistake is a chance to get smarter.
