[HOOK]
Success isn't what you think it is.

[BODY]
You say you want success, but do you want it more than sleep? More than parties or being cool? Most don't. They love comfort over ambition. To truly succeed, you must be willing to sacrifice rest. There will be times you'll run on three hours of sleep, maybe even two. You might need to push through nights without sleep at all. Because while you're resting, your opportunity could slip away.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're tempted to snooze, ask yourself: Do I want success more than sleep?
