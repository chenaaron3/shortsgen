[HOOK]
The second component of ikigai: the world has to need it.

[BODY]
We're hardwired to feel good when we're needed. Hunters and gatherers—everyone had a role. The cook mattered as much as the hunter. You could see the impact of your work. Now most of us work in offices. Small roles in big machines. Hard to see how we help anyone. You need something the world needs. Something that creates a visible positive effect on others.

[CLOSE]
Find where your skill meets a real need. That overlap is purpose.
