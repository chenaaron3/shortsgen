[HOOK]
Ever feel like you're barely staying afloat? Here's why it happens.

[BODY]
Picture this: we all sail in our own Lifeboat on the same vast ocean. Your Lifeboat is shaped by how deeply you're willing to face yourself. Some ride the waves easily, while others struggle in every storm. It's easy to skim the surface, avoiding the tough stuff. But here's the truth: if you truly dive in, giving your all, you won't be left wondering "What if?"

[CLOSE]
Next time you face a challenge, give it everything. Whether you succeed or not, you'll never have to question if you could have done more.
