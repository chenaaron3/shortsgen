```
[HOOK]
Ever feel intimidated just walking into a room?

[BODY]
It's not about them. It's about you not knowing who you are. You take the labels others give you and wear them like they're yours. That's why confidence crumbles. But what if you flipped the script? What if you wrote your own narrative?

[CLOSE]
Start today. Define who you are and walk into any room with your head held high. Your story, your terms.
