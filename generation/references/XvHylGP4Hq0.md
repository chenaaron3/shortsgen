[HOOK]
The bridge to your dreams isn't what you expect.

[BODY]
Imagine learning a math problem. It might take 10 hours. Now ask yourself: How badly do you want that next level? What will you sacrifice? What will you give up? Who will you let go? The gap between your vision and reality is vast. But discipline is the bridge that spans it.

[CLOSE]
Every day, face yourself. Remember, your discipline doesn't just change your life—it can change millions.
