[HOOK]
What if I told you, you have six hidden hours every day?

[BODY]
Think about it. We all get 24 hours. Subtract sleep—that's 6 hours. Work takes another 10. Maybe you travel 2 hours. But look closer: you still have 6 hours left. Six hours every day you could use to learn, grow, or build something amazing. Imagine reading about history for just one hour daily. After a year, you'd have 365 hours of knowledge. Or focus that time on a new business idea.

[CLOSE]
Ask yourself: what will you do with those 6 hours today? Make them count.
