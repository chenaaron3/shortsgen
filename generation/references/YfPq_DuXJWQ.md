[HOOK]
Courage isn't the absence of fear. So, what is it?

[BODY]
Fear hits you in the throat or gut. It's physical. But courage? It's also physical. Courage means feeling the fear... and pushing through it. When you step beyond your comfort zone, you tap into a hidden strength. This strength can transform your body, emotions, and relationships.

[CLOSE]
Next time fear grips you, remember: feeling fear means you're ready to grow.
