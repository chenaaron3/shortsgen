[HOOK]
Alcohol isn't just a drink. It's a trap that sneaks up on you.

[BODY]
For some, it's the anxiety relief. For others, it's the social buzz, or even a euphoric high. Sometimes, it's all three. That's why it lures you in. It starts slow, maybe just a drink at dinner. But soon, it creeps in earlier and earlier, until it owns your day. It feels like an escape, but it becomes a cage.

[CLOSE]
Recognize the pattern. Next time you reach for a drink, ask: "Is this relief or a trap?"
