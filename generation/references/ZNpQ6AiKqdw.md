[HOOK]
What if I told you that greatness isn't the goal?

[BODY]
Imagine telling your younger self: "You'll do great things, but you don’t need to be great. Just be you." The truth is, you only start loving something once you get good at it. But here's the catch—you get good by doing it, even when you're terrible. Pain moves you faster than pleasure ever will. Feeling sad? It’s okay. But don't let it steer your decisions.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're hit by a wave of emotions, acknowledge it, then get back to being you. That's more than enough.
