[HOOK]
Why does cleaning your room reduce anxiety?

[BODY]
Picture a chaotic room. Clothes everywhere, papers piled up. It feels overwhelming, right? That's because chaos creates too many pathways, too many distractions. Your mind can't find peace with all that noise. But when you order your room, you clear those pathways. It's not just about tidiness—it's about confronting what you avoid.

[CLOSE]
Start with one corner. Clear it. Feel the calm in simplicity. Then move to the next. Your mind mirrors your space.
