[HOOK]  
Success isn't instant—it's a 30-year journey.

[BODY]  
Imagine being the uncoordinated kid who struggles to find his footing. It took 2,000 speaking gigs to finally feel comfortable on stage. Three thriving businesses before thinking, "Maybe I'm a real businessman." Now, with seven businesses and pushing a billion in real estate, the feeling of "making it" is just starting to sink in. 

[CLOSE]  
Remember, success is built over time. Keep pushing. Your breakthrough might be just around the corner.
