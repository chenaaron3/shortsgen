[HOOK]
Your greatest gift isn't what you think it is.

[BODY]
We all have talents. Some sing, some dance. But here's the twist: talent alone doesn't lead to recognition. Imagine living through chaos, doubts, and setbacks. Yet, one person rises above. How? Not by talent alone, but by clearing the mind.

[CLOSE]
Free your mind from distractions—no drugs, no alcohol. That's when your true gift shines.
