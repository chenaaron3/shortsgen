[HOOK]
Do you really want it? Here's how to know.

[BODY]
If you crave something enough to fight for it day and night, to give up your comfort and sleep for it, then you're on the right path. When every thought and dream revolves around it, when life feels empty without it, you're truly dedicated. You plan, sweat, and face every challenge head-on. Nothing—poverty, pain, or fear—can deter you. 

[CLOSE]
Pursue what you want with unwavering determination. If you fight with all your might, you'll achieve it.
