```
[HOOK]
The hardest person to face is... yourself.

[BODY]
It's so easy to point fingers at others, isn't it? But looking in the mirror? That's tough. Admitting "I'm wrong" in your own reflection takes real courage. We resist change because it means confronting our flaws. Yet, true growth starts when we critique ourselves, not others.

[CLOSE]
Today, stand in front of the mirror and say, "I can improve here." That's where transformation begins.
