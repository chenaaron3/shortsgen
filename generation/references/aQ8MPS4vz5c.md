[HOOK]
Alcohol tricks you into thinking you're something you're not.

[BODY]
You feel sophisticated, like a comedian on stage. But in reality, it makes everyone look foolish. Remember Barney from The Simpsons? He thought he was cool—until the drink wore off. The real tragedy? It builds a fence around you. Friends may gather at the edge, but no one gets in. You're left alone, trapped by the very thing you thought was helping.

[CLOSE]
Next time you reach for a drink, ask yourself: Is this building a fence or tearing it down?
