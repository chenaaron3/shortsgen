[HOOK]
Manifesting isn't about attracting what you want.

[BODY]
It's about realizing you attract what you are. If you think about it, we become what we think about. Your thoughts shape your reality. Change how you think, and you change the world you live in. It's like a hidden truth—often overlooked—that your mindset is the real magnet.

[CLOSE]
Today, try shifting one negative thought to a positive one. Watch how your world starts to change.
