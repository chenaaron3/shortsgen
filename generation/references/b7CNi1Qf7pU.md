[HOOK]
Focused attention meditation strengthens the part of your brain that solves problems.

[BODY]
Focus on one stimulus—sound, sensation, or a visual object. Researchers found it activates the anterior cingulate cortex. That region detects errors, overcomes impulses, and solves problems. Practicing this form improves all three. It's perfect if you want to excel in school or career. It trains your brain to find solutions more effectively.

[CLOSE]
Pick one anchor. Your breath, a sound, an object. Return to it. Your focus sharpens.
