[HOOK]
The moment you feel like quitting? That's actually when you're closest to success.

[BODY]
We've all been there—feeling trapped, like nothing's going right. It's tempting to give up. But those moments? They're pivotal. They're the moments that define your character. The real question is: how will you respond? Because when it feels the hardest, you're closest to what you've always wanted.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're ready to quit, remember: it's not the end—it's your defining moment. Push through.
