[HOOK]
You can't save your way out of the rat race.

[BODY]
The system is broken. Hard work and cutting costs won't free you. Step one: accept that. Step two: increase your income stream. Keep your job if you need to—you need that flow. The bigger the stream, the more chances you have. Step three: take asymmetrical bets. Limited downside, almost unlimited upside. A decent chance of extraordinary returns. That's the key—a decent chance.

[CLOSE]
Protect your income. Then bet small on big possibilities.
