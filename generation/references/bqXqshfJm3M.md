[HOOK]
Pain can either be your tombstone or your triumph.

[BODY]
We all face pain. For some, it becomes a tombstone—an end. For others, it becomes a scar—a mark of survival and growth. The difference? It's how you choose to live with it. In 2025, when you're faced with life's choices—doctor, lawyer, teacher, or even president—there's one box you must check first.

[CLOSE]
Before anything else, check yourself. Decide if your pain will bury you or build you.
