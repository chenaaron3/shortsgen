[HOOK]
What's the secret to playing big and winning? It's not what you think.

[BODY]
You dream of playing big, but every time it gets tough, you back off. Why? Because it's still optional in your mind. Imagine pushing every option off the table. No more debating. No more wondering if you should climb the mountain. You just climb. You demand the mountain bow down to you.

[CLOSE]
Make it non-negotiable. Trust in yourself like never before. You've been built for this moment. You're perfect for the job.
