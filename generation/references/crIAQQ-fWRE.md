[HOOK]
What if failing was the smartest thing you could do?

[BODY]
We're taught that failure means you're not smart. Schools drill this into us. Memorize, get the right answer, avoid risk. But real life? It's different. Failure is a tool. Each mistake teaches you something new. It's not a sign to stop—it's a chance to get smarter. 

[CLOSE]
Next time you fail, don't retreat. Ask: "What can I learn from this?" Let failure be your teacher.
