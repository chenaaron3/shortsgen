[HOOK]
Are you living for "one day" or "day one"?

[BODY]
We often say, "I'll start one day." It's a comforting thought.
It keeps us safe from failing, but also from succeeding.
The truth is, "one day" never comes unless you turn it into "day one."
Today can be that day if you decide.

[CLOSE]
Choose today as your day one. Begin now and see where it leads.
