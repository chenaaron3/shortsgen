[HOOK]
What if quitting made pain last forever?

[BODY]
Pain feels endless. It grips you for minutes, hours, sometimes even years. But here's the twist: it always fades. Something new always comes. But if you quit? That decision lingers. It stays with you longer than any discomfort.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're on the edge of giving up, remember: push through. Pain is temporary, but quitting leaves a permanent mark.
