```
[HOOK]
You can't change your life by waiting for others.

[BODY]
If you keep doing what you've always done, you'll get what you've always got.
Waiting for someone else to change things keeps you stuck.
The real change begins when you decide to act, not rely on others.

[CLOSE]
Take one step today that's true to who you are. It's your move.
