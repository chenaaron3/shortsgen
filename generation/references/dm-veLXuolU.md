[HOOK]
What if the worst thing in life is getting too comfortable?

[BODY]
David Goggins, a man who conquered Navy SEAL training, Army Ranger school, and Air Force tactical air controller training, believes fear is his ultimate guide. Why? Because when you lose that fear, you lose the hunger for life. The moment you feel you've "arrived," you start to settle. And that's when you become your own worst enemy.

[CLOSE]
Challenge yourself to feel fear again. Step into discomfort, and reignite your hunger for life.
