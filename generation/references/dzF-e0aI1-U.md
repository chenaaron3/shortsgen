[HOOK]
Want to become extraordinary? Embrace your inner child.

[BODY]
Look at Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist. Sure, he was brilliant in science, but he was also known for drumming on the roof and becoming an artist in his 60s. Feynman never got stuck in his ways. His secret? A childlike curiosity and openness.

[CLOSE]
Stay light, stay loose. Give life everything you've got. Let your brain change by exploring like a child.
