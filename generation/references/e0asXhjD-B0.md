[HOOK]
Think you're stuck? It's all in your head.

[BODY]
I just spoke to someone who got bad news at work. They felt trapped. But here's the truth: You're only stuck in your mind. Waiting to feel ready or confident? That day won't come. Confidence isn't the starting line—it's the finish.

[CLOSE]
Today, take one courageous step. Trust yourself. The moment you act, confidence will follow. So, go do it. Bet on you.
