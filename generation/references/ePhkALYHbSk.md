[HOOK]
Guided meditation is the easiest way to start.

[BODY]
A narrator walks you through it. You follow their instructions. No dealing with complete silence or the doubts that come when you sit alone. Sessions vary by app or video. Benefits: it's training wheels. You get used to sitting still before moving to more advanced forms. No shame in that.

[CLOSE]
If other meditation felt too hard—try guided. Build the habit first.
