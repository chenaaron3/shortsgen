[HOOK]
What if I told you your purpose is always right in front of you?

[BODY]
Imagine having no races to run, no classes to attend, no clear goals. Many feel lost without a purpose to drive them. But the truth is, real performance happens when there's nothing on the schedule. If you can't perform at your best without external goals, you'll falter when opportunities arise. We chase this elusive thing called purpose, thinking it's out there somewhere. But here's the twist: your purpose isn't something you find.

[CLOSE]
It's you. You are the purpose. Embrace that, and you'll always be ready to perform at your highest level.
