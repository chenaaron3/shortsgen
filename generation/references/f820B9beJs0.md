[HOOK]
Here's why chasing greatness might be holding you back.

[BODY]
Imagine telling your younger self: "You're going to do great things, but you don't have to be great." The real secret? Just be yourself—that's always enough. You only start liking something when you get good at it. But you only get good by doing it over and over, even when it feels painful. Pain can drive you faster than pleasure. Feeling sad? It’s okay. It doesn’t mean you'll make bad choices. It’s just a wave you ride.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're overwhelmed, remember: be yourself and keep moving. You're enough as you are.
