[HOOK]
There's someone waiting for you... and they're closer than you think.

[BODY]
Every morning, you face them. They've been there through every challenge, every doubt. But you've been too harsh, too critical. This person craves your encouragement. They need you to celebrate their efforts, to support their journey. 

[CLOSE]
Start each day by looking in the mirror. Truly see yourself. Forgive, honor, and believe in that person staring back at you. This daily connection is the deep bond you've been missing.
