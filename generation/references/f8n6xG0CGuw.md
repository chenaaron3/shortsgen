[HOOK]
Congratulations, you've achieved failure. Now what?

[BODY]
Most people fear failure. It's scary. Nobody wants to go that far. But here's the secret: failure is just the first step. It's the gateway to success. Since the '70s, nothing's changed. Winning has always been found on the other side of failure.

[CLOSE]
So, the next time you fail, celebrate. You're on the right track. Keep going until you win.
