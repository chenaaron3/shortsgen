[HOOK]
Asking out your crush comes down to three steps.

[BODY]
Step one: get their attention. In person or online. Step two: say it. "Hey, I like you. Let's go on a date—blank place, blank time." Step three: look them in the eye. Don't say anything. Wait for the answer. Yes, an excuse, or no. If they reject you, embrace the pain. Pain lights a fire. Pain makes you take action. Pain makes you stronger.

[CLOSE]
Say it. Wait. Whatever happens, you showed up.
