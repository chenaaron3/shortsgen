[HOOK]
Courage isn't what you think it is.

[BODY]
I used to believe courage meant winning a Medal of Honor. I thought it was about grand acts. But here's what I learned: courage is putting on those boots every single day. It's being willing to step into the unknown, to fight when no one is watching, and no one knows where you are.

[CLOSE]
True courage is in the daily grind. It's in showing up. Lace up your boots and face the day—even when it's tough.
