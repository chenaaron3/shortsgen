[HOOK]
Comfort is the enemy of greatness. Here's why.

[BODY]
It's tempting to surround ourselves with people who say, "Take a break, relax, enjoy." They make us feel good, secure, and accepted. But these are the voices that keep us comfortable. They shield us from facing our weaknesses and challenges. They make us the best among the average, but not truly great.

[CLOSE]
Seek those who push you, who challenge your limits. Growth lives beyond comfort.
