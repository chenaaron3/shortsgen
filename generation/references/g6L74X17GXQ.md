[HOOK]
Why do the most exceptional people often feel alone?

[BODY]
The path to greatness is rarely crowded. When you choose to stand out, you walk a road less traveled. It feels lonely because you're not following the crowd. But here's the thing: if everyone else is cheering you on, you're not truly standing apart. You're just blending in.

[CLOSE]
Embrace the solitude. It's a sign you're on an extraordinary journey.
