[HOOK]
What if your biggest shame is actually your first step to freedom?

[BODY]
Imagine facing two DUIs, a looming job loss, and chaos everywhere. That's where I found myself. Alcohol was once my social glue, but soon it was my nightly companion, alone. The shame felt overwhelming. But here's the twist: that shame pointed to my wake-up call.

[CLOSE]
If your habits control you, face the shame. It might just be the map to your freedom.
