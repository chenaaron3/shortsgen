[HOOK]
When pain feels endless, what's the one thing you should never let go of?

[BODY]
It's tough when you're in the middle of a storm. Pain feels like it won't stop, suffering seems never-ending. It's hard to picture a brighter future when you're stuck in the dark. But there's one thing that can guide you through: belief. 

[CLOSE]
Hold onto belief like a lifeline. Keep believing, and you'll emerge victorious. Brighter days are coming. Just don't let go.
