```
[HOOK]
Failure is the mother of all success. But why?

[BODY]
In today's world, we're tricked into believing in perfection and instant wins. But that's a myth. Falling short isn't the end—it's a teacher. Each slip and stumble is a lesson. Every setback is a stepping stone.

[CLOSE]
Embrace failure. Work hard. The more you strive, the luckier you become.
