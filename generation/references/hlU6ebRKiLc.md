```
[HOOK]
Your environment might be holding you back.

[BODY]
Think about this: Are you surrounded by people who lift you up or pull you down? If your circle spends more time gossiping than growing, you're in the wrong conversation. While they're stuck talking about others, you should be focusing on your own dreams. Your vision, your goals. Hanging with the wrong crowd can lead you astray. Consuming negativity impacts your mindset too.

[CLOSE]
Surround yourself with energy that fuels your ambitions. Tune into positivity and chart your own path.
