[HOOK]
Feeling alone? The answer isn't what you think.

[BODY]
When you're in that dark place, it feels like no one cares.
But here's the truth: you don't need their approval.
The first step is learning to love yourself.
It's about self-love, not outside validation.

[CLOSE]
Start by doing one thing today just for you. Fall in love with who you are.
