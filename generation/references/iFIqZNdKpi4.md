[HOOK]
These studying tips sound strange—but they work.

[BODY]
First: use 40 Hz sound. Huberman recommends it five minutes before or during your study session to sharpen focus. Second: overt visual focus. Stare at one spot—a dot on the wall, a water bottle—for 30 seconds. It trains your attention. Third: spike adrenaline right after you learn. Studies link adrenaline to memory formation. Jump in a cold shower after a study session and the lesson sticks.

[CLOSE]
Try one tip this week. Then another. Your brain will thank you.
