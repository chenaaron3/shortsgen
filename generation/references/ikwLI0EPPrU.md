[HOOK]
Fear isn't your biggest obstacle to success. It's something much simpler.

[BODY]
We all feel fear, but that's not what holds us back. Einstein once said imagination is more important than knowledge, yet knowledge fuels imagination. The real barrier? Lack of business knowledge. Think accounting, debt, and taxes. These are the skills that aren't taught in school.

[CLOSE]
Want to break free? Start learning the basics of debt and taxes. Empower your imagination with real-world knowledge.
