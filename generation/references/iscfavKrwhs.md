[HOOK]
Want to play big but keep stumbling? Here's the shift you need.

[BODY]
Many dream of making it big, but when things get tough, they retreat. It's because they treat their dreams as optional. Imagine removing all other options. The mountain ahead no longer intimidates because failure isn't on the table. It's about choosing certainty in yourself—believing in you like never before.

[CLOSE]
Make your dream non-negotiable. Trust that you're perfectly built for this moment.
