[HOOK]
Do you want to be dangerous… or vague and useless?

[BODY]
There's a power that comes with being articulate. It's not just about speaking well. It's about mastering your own tongue. When you can clearly express your thoughts, you become competent. The most exceptional form of being dangerous is being articulate. But remember, every advantage has a downside. Like extroverts: they're social and positive, but they can be impulsive and struggle with solitude.

[CLOSE]
Embrace the power of clear expression. Start by mastering your words. It's the first step to being truly competent.
