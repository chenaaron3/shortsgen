```
[HOOK]
Think you can't succeed because you're not "born for it"? Think again.

[BODY]
We often doubt ourselves, thinking success is reserved for certain people. We say things like, "I could never do that," or "Only others can achieve that." But this mindset traps us. Confidence fuels success, and success fuels confidence. They work together.

[CLOSE]
Believe in your potential. Tell yourself, "There's nothing I can't do." Start today—embrace the divine within you.
