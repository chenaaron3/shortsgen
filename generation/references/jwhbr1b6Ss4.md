```
[HOOK]
Do you think you need to fit in to be happy?

[BODY]
You see everyone around you—smoking, drinking, wearing the same brands. It's easy to think, "I have to do this to belong." But what if that's not true? What if doing what they do isn't what makes you happy?

[CLOSE]
Focus on what truly brings you joy. Live your life, not theirs.
