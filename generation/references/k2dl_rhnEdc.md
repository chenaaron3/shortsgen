[HOOK]
Ever felt stuck, like you're living in a hole you can't escape?

[BODY]
One day, I hit my breaking point. I decided enough was enough. I wasn't going to lie down and accept defeat. I became obsessed with pushing my limits, with proving I'm capable of more. Every time I pushed through, it was a step closer to freedom. I kept my head high, even when it was tough.

[CLOSE]
When you feel stuck, remember: stand up and fight. Push through. Keep your head high and take that step forward.
