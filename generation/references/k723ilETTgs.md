```
[HOOK]
What's the real reason we stop pushing boundaries?

[BODY]
We face a challenge and think, "That sounds hard." So, we stop innovating. We stop creating. And with that, we risk losing respect for ourselves—because we didn't make a difference.

[CLOSE]
Do everything. Do it scared. That's how we keep evolving.
