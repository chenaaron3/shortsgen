[HOOK]
Why do eagles fly into storms?

[BODY]
An eagle is the only bird that flies straight into a storm. Not away. Into it. It's time for you to become like the eagle. You have a dream, an idea, a calling. But doubt and fear hold you back. Your knees tremble, your palms sweat. Yet, champions rise from the ashes of fear.

[CLOSE]
Run toward your storm. Chase your dream. The time is now.
