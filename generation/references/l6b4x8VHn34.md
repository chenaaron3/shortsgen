[HOOK]
A psychologist raised a glass of water. The question wasn't half empty or half full.

[BODY]
She asked: how heavy is this glass? People guessed. She said: it depends how long I hold it. A minute—light. A day—my arm goes numb. The weight never changes. The duration does. Stresses and worries are like that glass. Think about them briefly—nothing. A bit longer—they hurt. All day—you feel paralyzed.

[CLOSE]
Put the glass down. Let go of what you've been carrying too long.
