[HOOK]
Can't sit still? Try moving meditation.

[BODY]
Focus completely on movement—walking, chores, yoga, dancing. Feel your feet touch the ground. Notice the physical sensations. The main benefit: it teaches flow. Dance forces you to be creative and present at once. Who it's for: anyone who has trouble sitting still. Health issues, or you just feel too jittery.

[CLOSE]
If sitting meditation isn't for you—move. Walk, dance, stretch. Presence can happen in motion.
