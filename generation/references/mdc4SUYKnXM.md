[HOOK]
Parkinson's Law: work expands to fill the time you give it.

[BODY]
A project due in three months? You'll do almost nothing for two and a half months, then cram. The same applies to your dreams. I'm paranoid—every flight I imagine the plane crashing. But that doesn't paralyze me. Death is unavoidable. So I want to experience as much as possible before my time runs out. Feeling like I don't have much time left makes me take action every day.

[CLOSE]
Act like you have less time than you do. Your ambition will expand to fill it.
