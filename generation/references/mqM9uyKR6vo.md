```
[HOOK]
Are you living as a slave or a negotiator in your own life?

[BODY]
Many of us work jobs we can't stand. We tell ourselves it's for our family, and that's okay. But here's the catch: if it's not openly discussed, it becomes a silent burden. We often default to being slaves to our situation or tyrants of our emotions—because avoiding discussion takes no effort. 

[CLOSE]
Start the conversation. Negotiate your reality. Don't settle for silent suffering.
