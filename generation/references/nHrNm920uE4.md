[HOOK]
You don't have to be a prodigy to succeed.

[BODY]
Think of Tiger Woods—swinging a golf club like a pro as a toddler. That's not everyone's story. Most of us aren't born with that kind of talent. But here's the thing: You don't need it. The real game-changer is something else entirely—work ethic and discipline. These aren't flashy, but they are sustainable. They keep you in the game long after natural talent fades.

[CLOSE]
Focus on building your discipline. It's the trait that fuels success over the long haul.
