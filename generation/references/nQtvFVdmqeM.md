[HOOK]
Pain is inevitable. But suffering without reward? That's a choice.

[BODY]
You're already in pain. Life throws its punches, and maybe your past wasn't fair.
You carry stories of absent parents or past betrayals. It's real, it hurts.
But why let those stories dictate your future? Why let them own you for decades?

[CLOSE]
Turn your pain into power. Get a reward for what you've endured—forge a future on your terms.
