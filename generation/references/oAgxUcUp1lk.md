[HOOK]
Imagine telling your grandkids you missed life because of fear.

[BODY]
Picture this: Your grandkids ask, "Granddad, what was it like when you were young?" 
And all you can say is, "I didn't do much. I was too worried about what others thought." 
You never took off your shirt because you hated how you looked. 
You never started that business because you feared failure. 
Just think how silly that sounds.

[CLOSE]
Blink and you'll miss it. Make your one shot at life count. Take the risk.
