[HOOK]
Hustle culture is misleading you.

[BODY]
You're told to grind every second, never rest. But this obsession? It's out of balance. Young men need to know it's okay to pause, to think, to just be. The real question is, when life gets tough, how do you respond? Do you become a victim, drowning in complaints? Or do you find meaning and strength in the struggle?

[CLOSE]
Next time you're overwhelmed, stop. Reflect. Choose to show up with purpose, not just with hustle.
