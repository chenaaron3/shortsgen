[HOOK]
You don't need to follow the path laid out for you.

[BODY]
Imagine growing up in post-war Austria. Your parents want you to stay, work a stable job, maybe become a police officer like your dad. They dream of you marrying a local girl named Heidi. But deep down, you know that's not your path. You feel destined for something different, something bigger. Your vision doesn't match theirs.

[CLOSE]
Your life is yours to shape. Find your unique vision and let it guide you.
