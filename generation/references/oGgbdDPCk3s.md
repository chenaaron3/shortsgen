[HOOK]
Success isn't about being smart—it's about something else entirely.

[BODY]
Growing up, my dad called me Fireball because of my endless little ventures. But he taught me a lesson more valuable than any business tip: have an inner scorecard. It's not about what others think; it's about knowing why you're doing what you do. My dad didn't care about money. He cared about values. I spent hours reading, not to be the smartest, but to develop the right temperament. 

[CLOSE]
Remember, true success is having the right mindset and being loved by those you cherish. Focus on your inner scorecard, not external validation.
