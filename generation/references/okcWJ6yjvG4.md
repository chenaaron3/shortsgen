[HOOK]
Your success depends on who you talk to for no reason.

[BODY]
Imagine chatting daily with someone who's got nothing going on. What can they teach you? Probably not much. Now, think about those who strive to live life on the highest level. They push boundaries, seek growth, and continue to succeed. They're the ones who offer valuable insights and lessons.

[CLOSE]
Next time you strike up a conversation, choose someone who inspires you. Let their energy elevate yours.
