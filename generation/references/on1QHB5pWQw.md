[HOOK]
Stopping isn't enough. Here's the real key to breaking an addiction.

[BODY]
You might think quitting is the hardest part. But it's about finding something more important than the addiction. Imagine the future if you continue—really picture those negative consequences. You have to let parts of your old self die to be reborn anew. 

[CLOSE]
Got big ambitions? Choose them over drugs and alcohol. Focus on what you want to create, not what you want to escape.
