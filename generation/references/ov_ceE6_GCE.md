```
[HOOK]
The secret to getting better at talking to people isn't what you think.

[BODY]
You weren't born socially handicapped. Babies learn to speak purely through observation. Your brain is built to pick up patterns and rules in social interaction. The reason your skills aren't great? You haven't given your brain enough time to observe and become fluent. You lack practice.

[CLOSE]
Talk to more people. That's it. Give your brain more opportunities to learn the language of connection.
