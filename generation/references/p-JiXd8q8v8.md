[HOOK]
What if I told you there's a mindset that makes you unbeatable?

[BODY]
Imagine facing criticism and setbacks. Most people crumble under the pressure. But some see it differently. They believe no one can truly defeat them. Why? Because defeat is a choice. You can be damaged, criticized, or doubted, but you decide if it's the end.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're knocked down, tell yourself: "I may be hit, but I'm not beaten." Stand back up.
