[HOOK]
Are you living for applause or purpose?

[BODY]
We often chase success, craving validation from others. But life isn't a popularity contest. Being brave means knowing your true path. It's about answering, "What's my hill?"—the one thing worth climbing. When you stop seeking approval and start focusing on who you truly want to be, everything changes.

[CLOSE]
This week, ask yourself: What is my hill? Then, start climbing it.
