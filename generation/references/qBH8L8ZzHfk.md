[HOOK]
Believing in yourself is a five-step process.

[BODY]
One: notice what you tell yourself. Find the negative thoughts. Two: flip them. "I am weak" becomes "I am strong." Three: find proof. Never worked out? Do a 30-minute routine. That's proof you're stronger. Four: repeat the new thought every time you find proof. "I am mentally strong." Five: keep gathering proof. Keep repeating. Until the new thought becomes your default.

[CLOSE]
Proof plus repetition. That's how belief changes.
