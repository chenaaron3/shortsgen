[HOOK]
Loving pain might be the secret to your next breakthrough.

[BODY]
In 2008, SpaceX's Falcon rocket failed three times. Tesla almost went bankrupt. The pressure was intense. But instead of avoiding the pain, they embraced it. They pushed through the chaos and uncertainty.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're struggling, ask yourself: "Can I love this pain enough to grow from it?"
