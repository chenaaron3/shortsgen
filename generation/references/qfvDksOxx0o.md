```
[HOOK]
What if I told you not to define yourself by your successes?

[BODY]
Imagine writing a best-selling book. It's tempting to label yourself as an author forever. But here's the catch: when you cling to one identity, you risk getting trapped by it. Instead, see yourself as "an author right now." This mindset frees you to evolve.

[CLOSE]
Ask yourself: "What am I right now?" Let that guide you, and be ready to change when it no longer serves you.
