[HOOK]
Metta meditation sends love in every direction. Including toward people you dislike.

[BODY]
Loving-kindness meditation: visualize and send love to yourself, a friend, a stranger, someone you dislike, then the universe. Repeat a phrase like "may I be happy." Benefits: more empathy, less pain, fewer negative emotions. It can help with PTSD. Who it's for: anyone carrying hate or anger—toward themselves or others.

[CLOSE]
Start with yourself. May I be happy. Then extend it outward.
