[HOOK]
You need to fall in love with pain. But why?

[BODY]
In 2008, Elon Musk faced brutal challenges. SpaceX's Falcon rocket failed three times. Tesla nearly went bankrupt. They closed financing on Christmas Eve, by a hair. Most would crumble, but Musk thrived. His secret? A high pain threshold.

[CLOSE]
Embrace discomfort. When challenges hit, ask yourself: "What's my pain threshold?" Then push it higher.
