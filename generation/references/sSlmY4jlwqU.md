[HOOK]
What if I told you pain is your greatest ally?

[BODY]
Right now, you're feeling it. It's sharp, relentless, and not what you wanted. But here's the twist: pain isn't just an obstacle—it's a tool. Every challenge you're facing right now? It's shaping you. Instead of resisting, embrace it. Pain isn't here to break you.

[CLOSE]
Next time it hurts, remember: it's not here to end you—it's here to make you stronger. Lean into it and carry on.
