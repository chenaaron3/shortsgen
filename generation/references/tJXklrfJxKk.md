[HOOK]  
The biggest mistake? Playing it safe.

[BODY]  
Imagine living your whole life inside a comfort zone. No risks, no leaps. Just safety. Nelson Mandela warned us: there's no passion in playing small. Settling for less means missing out on your true potential.

[CLOSE]  
This week, take one small risk. Step out of your comfort zone. That's where passion lives.
