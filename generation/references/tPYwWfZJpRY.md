Does success really require suffering?

[BODY]
I noticed something strange: the more I suffered, the better my work seemed. Struggle became my badge of honor. It felt earned. Suffering was the lead indicator I trusted for success. But then, I took a shortcut. I started equating suffering with worth. If success came easily, I doubted its value. I dismissed my achievements unless they came with struggle.

Ask yourself: Are you chasing success or suffering? Reevaluate what truly matters.
