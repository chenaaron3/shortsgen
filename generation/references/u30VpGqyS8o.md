[HOOK]
Want to know why some people stay broke? It's not what you think.

[BODY]
If you choose to play stupid, you'll stay stupid—and broke. There's no school for this. Life doesn't hand out degrees in street smarts. You have to be sharp, absorbing every bit of information as it comes your way. It's not about sitting in a classroom; it's about learning from every experience.

[CLOSE]
Start today. Be smart enough to learn as you go. Absorb everything. That's how you win the game.
