[HOOK]
The real tragedy isn't living beneath your potential. It's dying there.

[BODY]
Every day, people silence their dreams. They listen to voices saying, "You don't belong." They risk dying a death of mediocrity—living a life that's just average. But there's more at stake than just a life unlived. It's the potential buried with it.

[CLOSE]
Don’t drop the mic. Your destiny is waiting. Push past the doubt and keep moving forward.
