[HOOK]
Success can be the most dangerous drug.

[BODY]
When you achieve success, it feels like everything's handed to you. You feel invincible. But that's when mistakes sneak in—when you think you're untouchable. Success tricks you into letting your guard down. 

[CLOSE]
Keep your back against the wall. When there's nowhere to go but forward, you'll stay sharp and focused.
