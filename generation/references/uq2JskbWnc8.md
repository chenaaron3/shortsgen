[HOOK]
Why can't you stay motivated forever?

[BODY]
Imagine dreaming of running 135 miles but struggling to even run one. When motivation fades, you need something stronger to hold you up. That's discipline. Choosing one thing to master is your foundation. It's not about doing everything at once. It's about picking one discipline and sticking to it.

[CLOSE]
Find your primary discipline. Master it. Then, when you're ready, branch out. That's how you become unstoppable.
