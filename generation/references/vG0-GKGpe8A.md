[HOOK]
The biggest risk you face daily is one you might not even recognize.

[BODY]
We're taught to play it safe, to avoid risk. But here's the twist: playing it too safe can actually make you less smart. Think about it. If you don't take risks, how do you grow? Imagine flying in Vietnam—high risk, but the necessity to learn was even higher. Risk forces you to study, to adapt, to evolve.

[CLOSE]
Next time you think, "I can't do that," ask yourself: is it fear or an escape? Challenge yourself to act. Growth lives beyond comfort.
