[HOOK]
Your first 100 videos... are supposed to suck.

[BODY]
Jimmy tells creators: create 100 videos, then watch the first five. You’ll cringe. It's not about instant success. It's about progress. Each video should be better than the last. This isn't a sprint. It's a marathon. In a world where attention is gold, the competition is fierce.

[CLOSE]
Commit to the long game. Focus on growth, not perfection. Your journey is just beginning.
