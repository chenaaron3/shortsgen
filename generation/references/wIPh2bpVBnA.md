```
[HOOK]
Are you stuck in a situation you know isn't right?

[BODY]
Many stay in jobs or relationships that feel wrong. Why? Because the comfort of a familiar lie feels better than facing the unknown. You know your boss won't suddenly recognize your worth. You know that relationship won't magically improve. But the fear of quitting or leaving keeps you there. It's time to be honest with yourself.

[CLOSE]
Take a deep breath, and acknowledge what you already know. Your future begins when you let go of what isn't working.
