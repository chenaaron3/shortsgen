[HOOK]
You can't change what you won't face.

[BODY]
Imagine trying to build a house on quicksand. That's what it's like when you deny your reality. If you lie to yourself about who you are, there's no solid ground to start from. It's just a false reality. But when you face the truth, no matter how tough it seems—"I'm not smart," "I lack courage"—you finally have a real starting point.

[CLOSE]
Embrace the truth about yourself. It's your solid ground to build a new path forward.
