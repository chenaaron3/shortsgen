```
[HOOK]
Ever been fooled by someone’s sweet talk?

[BODY]
They speak well, make promises, and trick your mind. You start trusting again, even if they've failed you before. Big Sam once said, "When they paint you a picture, don't let them paint you another." Once someone shows their true colors, don’t forget. Trust is earned, not given.

[CLOSE]
Reward loyalty with loyalty, but keep disloyalty at a distance. Forgive, but don't forget.
