[HOOK]
The way you talk about your tasks might be holding you back.

[BODY]
How often do you say, "I got to go to work" or "I got to work out"? We all do it. It feels like a burden, a list of chores we must complete. But what if you flipped it? Imagine saying, "I get to go to work" or "I get to go to the gym." This small change can shift your mindset from obligation to opportunity.

[CLOSE]
Next time you face a task, try saying "I get to" instead of "I got to." See how it transforms your day.
