[HOOK]
To get people to open up, reduce your filter first.

[BODY]
We're scared to say things because we fear how others will react. So we filter. Small talk. But we're all looking for someone we can share our strange thoughts with. If you show from the start that you don't care about being perfect, that you'll talk about the weird and socially unacceptable—people will open up. Caveat: there's a line between reduced filter and seeming crazy. It depends on your perceived value.

[CLOSE]
Be the one who goes first. Someone has to.
