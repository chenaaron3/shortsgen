[HOOK]
What if I told you, you have six extra hours each day to transform your life?

[BODY]
Imagine reading about history for just one hour daily. In a year, that's 365 hours of knowledge. Or, picture dedicating an hour to a business idea you’re passionate about. You’d be miles ahead in just one year. 

We all have 24 hours each day. Sleep takes about 6 hours, work maybe 10. With travel, you're left with 6 free hours. But how do you use them?

[CLOSE]
Ask yourself: How will you spend your 6 hours today to shape your future?
