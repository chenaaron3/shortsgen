[HOOK]
The first component of ikigai: it has to be something you love.

[BODY]
Things that make you stop thinking. That pull you into the present. Some call it flow. Most of us call it love. Arts, dancing, singing, reading—they take us into that state. Being with someone who lets us forget our problems—that's love too. We know in our gut when we truly love something. It's a feeling we all share.

[CLOSE]
Start with what makes you lose track of time. That's your first clue.
