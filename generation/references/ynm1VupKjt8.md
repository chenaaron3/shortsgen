[HOOK]
Once you're on the path out of the rat race—protect what you've built.

[BODY]
Step four: risk management. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. Don't borrow. Don't sell the house. Don't go all in. Survive to bet again. Step five: diversify and chill. If you hit the jackpot, you have life-changing money. Focus on preserving it. Managing wealth well can make you more than your old job ever did. Speak with a financial advisor.

[CLOSE]
Bet only what you can lose. Protect what you win. Rinse and repeat.
