[HOOK]
Why do some people change while others stay stuck?

[BODY]
Many try to escape their struggles. But until the pain becomes unbearable, they don't act. I've lost countless friends to addiction. If I hadn't faced my own discomfort, I might not be here today. Pain can be a powerful motivator for change.

[CLOSE]
When discomfort knocks, ask yourself: Is this the push I need to transform?
