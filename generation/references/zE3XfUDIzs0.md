[HOOK]
Why do smart people often rise to the top?

[BODY]
Think about life as a race. Everyone's trying to reach the finish line. But who gets there first? It's often the fastest. And intelligence? It's like having speed. It doesn't guarantee everything, but it helps you move quickly through complex problems. When you're racing toward something tough, those who think fast usually lead the pack.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're tackling a challenge, focus on how swiftly you can adapt and learn. Speed isn't just for runners—it's for thinkers too.
