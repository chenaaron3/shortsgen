[HOOK]
Ever notice how battles get fiercer right before you win?

[BODY]
It's like you're at the gate of your dreams, inches away, but you can't see it. That's when doubts scream the loudest. The world calls you stubborn, tries to pull you back. They don’t understand your vision. But here's the secret—when everyone says it's impossible, that's your cue you're on the right path. It's the world pushing back, proving you're close.

[CLOSE]
Wear their doubt like a badge. Let it fuel you. Keep pushing—you're almost there.
