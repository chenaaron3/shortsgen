[HOOK]
Think you've faced hardship? You might be more spoiled than you realize.

[BODY]
Imagine being homeless for two and a half years. That's real pain. Many of us have never felt anything like it. We're coddled, protected by parents who solve every problem for us. Every mistake, every misstep—someone else cleans it up. We're shielded from the struggle that shapes us. 

[CLOSE]
Next time you face a challenge, resist the urge to call for help. Embrace it. That's where growth begins.
