[HOOK]
Ever wonder why some people smile through the toughest workouts?

[BODY]
Back in the Pumping Iron days, people were puzzled when they saw me lifting weights for hours, yet always smiling. They couldn't figure it out. But I had a secret. Every single rep wasn't just a lift. It was a step toward the Mr. Universe title. Each push and pull brought my vision closer to reality. That's what fueled my grin.

[CLOSE]
Next time you're grinding, remember: every rep is a step. Keep your eyes on the prize.
