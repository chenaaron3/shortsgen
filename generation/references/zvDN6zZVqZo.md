[HOOK]
Your child's fear may hold the key to your transformation.

[BODY]
Imagine your son looking into your eyes, saying, "Dad, I thought you were going to die last night." His voice trembles as he admits, "I lost Grandpa. I can't lose you too." His plea isn't just about fear—it's about love. He asks, "Can you stop drinking? Can you be the dad I know?"

[CLOSE]
Listen to the ones who love you. Their fears can guide you back to who you truly are.
