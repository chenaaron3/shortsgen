00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,319
See, most of the people ruin their

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,480
entire day in the first 10 minutes. They

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,240
wake up and they grab their phone, then

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,480
scrolling social media and checking

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,240
messages and reading bad news, then

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,960
feeling stressed before the day even

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,359
begins. And without realizing it, they

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,600
put their mind into chaos mode. But your

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
first hour is powerful. It sets the

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,240
mood, focus, and energy for the whole

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,320
day. When you start with your phone, you

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,640
start reacting to life. But when you

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,840
start with silence and focus, you take

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,239
control. So, no phone, no distractions,

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,160
just you and your thoughts. Then you can

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,079
use that time to stretch your body,

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,000
journal your thoughts, or simply

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,960
breathe. And this one habit can

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,440
completely change your life in 2026. And

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,280
if you're serious about 2026, then
