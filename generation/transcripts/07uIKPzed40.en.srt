1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
You've been playing a game your entire

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,560
life without knowing the rules. And

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,639
that's why you keep losing. Everyone

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,040
thinks success is about working harder.

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,519
But here's the truth. The hardest

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,720
working person you know is probably the

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,600
most frustrated. Reality operates on

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,240
hidden rules. Three invisible levels

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,680
control everything. Level one, what

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,760
everyone sees. Level two, what actually

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,040
happens. Level three, why it happens.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,880
Want the cheat codes? Reciprocity.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,640
Give first without keeping score and

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,399
watch the universe keep a ledger you

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,559
can't see. 1% better daily. That's not

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,680
365% improvement. It's 37 times better.

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,000
Not percent times. Your environment

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,480
makes decisions for you. Put a book on

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,800
your pillow. Sleep in gym clothes. Make

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,800
good choices the lazy choice. Most

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
people push doors that open by pulling.
