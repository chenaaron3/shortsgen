Your 20s aren't what you think they are.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,319
That perfectly filtered path others seem

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,440
to be taking. It's just a highlight

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,519
reel, not reality. The greatest freedom

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,160
of your 20s isn't having it all figured

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,720
out. It's realizing nobody does. We're

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,480
fed this narrative of checking boxes by

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:24,800
certain ages, career by 23, relationship

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,560
by 25, house by 28. But behind those

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,760
Instagram posts, everyone's

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,719
experimenting, failing, and feeling

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,239
exactly like you do, uncertain. I've

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,920
talked with hundreds of people in their

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,960
30s and 40s about their 20s. None said,

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,120
"I wish I'd had my life more figured

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,840
out. Instead, they wish they'd worried

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,840
less and understood that the winding

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,840
path is the path. Your 20s are about

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
unlearning the myth that you should have

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,680
it all figured out, creating an identity

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,320
laboratory to discover who you are, and

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,079
building relationships that help you

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,079
grow, not just exist.
