1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Here's something nobody wants to hear.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,040
You're not unlucky. You're not cursed.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,200
You're emotionally stuck at the age when

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
your biggest trauma happened. And until

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,759
you admit that, you'll keep living the

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,240
same year over and over. Think about it.

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,840
You rage quit jobs when criticized. You

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,600
give the silent treatment instead of

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,439
communicating. You're still having the

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,359
same fight you had with your parents,

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,600
except now it's with your boss, your

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,439
partner, or that barista. When something

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,119
goes wrong, what's your first thought?

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,599
If it's about what someone else did to

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,160
you, congratulations. You've identified

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,320
your emotional age. That explosion over

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,399
minor inconveniences. That's not about

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,879
the spilled coffee. It's about feeling

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,800
unseen, unheard, the same feeling from

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,800
when you were seven. But here's the

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,559
beautiful truth. Growing up isn't about

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,719
getting older. It's about getting

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,200
honest. Your stuck patterns are just

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,199
unhealed wounds in a three-piece suit.

25
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,120
They're not your fault, but they are

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,280
your responsibility. And that

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,840
distinction, that's where your power

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,840
lives.
