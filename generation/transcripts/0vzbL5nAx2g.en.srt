1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
alcohol used to be this social thing I

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,779
used to connect with people and go out

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,019
had now become something I did nightly

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,179
alone by myself I woke up with the worst

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,400
hangover and for the first time ever I

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,160
had this voice in my head that said this

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,680
is not okay those situations created

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,859
such a deep level of Shame inside of me

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,199
that I wasn't able to shake alcohol in

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,240
the wake of those experiences and I just

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,640
like held on to that belief that real

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,380
Lucy came out when she was drinking up

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,480
until I gave it up alcohol played a

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,520
major role in my life I started drinking

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,860
young people who drink every day have

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,780
smaller brains I was drinking just

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,480
trying to take the pain away I actually

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,660
didn't know who I was until very

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,100
recently alcohol is not a health food I

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,840
kind of thought to myself that if I can

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,579
give up Alcove for a whole year that

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,660
proves I'm in control I will be able to

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,520
go back to it and this won't happen

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,520
again but obviously that's not the case
