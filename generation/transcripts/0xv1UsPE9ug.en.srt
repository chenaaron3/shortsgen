1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,330
see there are certain things you can do

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,670
certain routines or outfits you can put

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,710
on that will essentially trick you into

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,990
answering a certain state of mind what I

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,670
like to call the showtime trick almost

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,590
like an actor putting on a costume

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,690
before getting ready to perform in front

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,730
of the camera or an athlete doing a

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,650
special ritual before their game for

10
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,449
example LeBron James will throw some

11
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,550
chalk dust up in the air before playing

12
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,410
ball all of these unique rituals are

13
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,930
essentially ways for us to trick our

14
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,490
mind into putting our game face on it's

15
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,190
a way for us to tell our brain and body

16
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:35,110
hey it's show time it's time for us to

17
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:37,210
act a certain way and give it your all

18
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,309
none of us are born with these rituals

19
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,989
you have to build an association in your

20
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:42,730
mind almost like how you would build a

21
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:44,290
habit obtaining a ritual for the

22
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,329
showtime trick can actually be very

23
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,829
simple all you need to do is purposely

24
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,690
go out of your way to create a new

25
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,030
ritual and make sure that you do

26
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,690
something special immediately after the

27
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,690
first three times
