1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
you're not going to be successful in

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,440
life if you become a slave of these

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,019
Technologies a slave of these machines

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,240
now the question is how does one Take

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,340
Back Control and make these machines

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
into your slaves instead of the other

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,660
way around there's basically three

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,600
things that you can do strategy number

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,340
one is to Fight Fire with Fire I've been

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,740
using an extension for many many years

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,779
now called news feed Eradicator and it

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,640
completely eliminates the news feed from

13
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,439
my Facebook page there are apps like

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,480
this for Instagram Twitter and even

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,700
YouTube strategy number two is to

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
manipulate your physical environment I

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,360
found that working at home is near

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,340
impossible because that's where I tend

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,500
to relax so what I've done instead is

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,420
manipulate my physical environment by

21
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,000
going outside and working in random

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,340
cafes and finally strategy number three

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,440
training yourself like a dog and a great

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,360
way to do this is to work for a bit and

25
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,100
then purposely reward yourself for a

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,899
short period of time sort of like how

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,379
you would give a dog a treat after he

28
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,379
does a trick
