1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
you'll ruin your life somehow some way

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,819
it is everywhere everywhere it can pass

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,980
into all the cells and tissues of your

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:12,719
body it was a very Progressive decline

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,280
in my aspirations alcohol is no lives in

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,660
our society you want to figure out

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,760
something that you're doing with your

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,580
life that's worth not getting drunk and

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,740
screwing up I Drank In Search Of

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,699
Happiness and in search of a lifestyle

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,920
that I thought would bring me to

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,300
happiness it didn't and I woke up one

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,279
morning going wow I've drank a lot but

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,019
I'm still not happy what's that about I

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,880
recall in high school the motivational

16
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,920
speakers will come to my school and say

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,660
don't do drugs but absent from those

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,480
talks with any reference to alcohol

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,980
alcohol got introduced to my life you

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,300
might say well why do people drink too

21
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,820
much it's like if you like alcohol

22
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,579
that's a stupid question it is ingrained

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,920
it's the social glue that sticks

24
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,219
everything together

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,219
