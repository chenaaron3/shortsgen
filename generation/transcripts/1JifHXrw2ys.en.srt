1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
checking your phone 96 times a day.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,279
Look, that's once every 10 minutes

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,080
you're awake. And we wonder why we feel

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,400
anxious. Here's what nobody tells you.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,719
Your phone is designed like a casino.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,440
Those red notification badges, the

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,000
infinite scroll, it's all calculated

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,840
manipulation. But I discovered three

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,320
gamechanging tricks that gave me my life

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,800
back. First, grayscale mode. Instagram

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,279
and black and white hits different.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,680
Suddenly, that infinite scroll loses all

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,559
its power. Second, the 80% battery rule.

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,360
Stop obsessing over 100%. You'll

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,000
actually use your phone without anxiety.

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,039
Third, turn off everything except calls,

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,039
texts, and calendar. Every notification

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,280
is someone else's priority, becoming

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,000
your emergency. Your phone should be a

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,800
tool, not a tyrant. Try just one of

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,840
these today. Watch how different you

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,960
feel. The question is, will you take

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960
back control?
