1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
we all want to be happy but the majority

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,960
of us have no idea what to do see the

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,240
Japanese have a concept called ikigai

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,460
which roughly translates into a reason

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,559
for being you need to have a purpose for

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,420
being here but this is easier said than

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,220
done because there are four components

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,199
that you need to check off in order to

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,000
achieve ikigai now the interesting thing

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,859
about this Japanese formula is that you

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,539
can tell where you are in life and what

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,519
you need to work on by looking at the

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,080
components you have so far if all you

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,699
have is something that you love and are

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,260
good at then you have what's called a

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,640
passion on the other hand if you have

17
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,200
something that you love and you can see

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,940
how the world needs it then you have

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,200
what's called a mission now if you're

20
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,180
someone who has something you get paid

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,219
well for and are good at then you have

22
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,500
what most people in the world have which

23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,120
is a profession and finally if you get

24
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,800
paid well and it's something that you

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,079
know can help the world then you have

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,520
what's called a vocation you need to be

27
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,379
spending your time doing something that

28
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,300
you love that you can get better at that

29
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,100
pays well and that the world needs

30
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,660
without all four you will always feel

31
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,039
like you're missing something inside of
