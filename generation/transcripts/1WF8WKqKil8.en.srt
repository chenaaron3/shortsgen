1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,720
we must put on that suit of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,360
armor and prepare ourselves for

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,280
battle

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,080
yes every battle cannot be

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,760
won but the winning

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:22,160
attitude to not give

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,920
up is more than enough to carry on these

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,279
battles that we face each and every day

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,359
of Our

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,079
Lives they will continue to come and you

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,760
will not win every

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:39,160
battle and the battles that you face

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,440
will help you to get stronger cuz even

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,520
if you lose a battle and you're still

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,160
breathing and you're still walking and

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,920
you're still able to make

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:56,160
moves then you still have enough fight

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,160
left to carry on
