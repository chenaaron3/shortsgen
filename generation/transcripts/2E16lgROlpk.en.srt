1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
hurt people hurt people a lie that is

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,500
far overused but so [ __ ] true when

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,860
someone is hurt instead of actually

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,839
looking internally and finding a way to

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,080
fix whatever the [ __ ] is going on in

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,580
their minds in their world they like to

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,100
hurt people they want to bring people

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,119
down to their level so when it comes to

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,640
bullying nobody that is intentionally

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,640
trying to hurt your feelings is happy

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,219
period And I believe that as if it's a

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
fact if someone is happy they're not

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,059
behind a computer screen they're not

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,440
face to face intentionally trying to

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,079
tear someone apart when someone's happy

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,540
they have goals when someone's happy

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,879
they're inspired when someone's happy

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,059
they generally just want what's best for

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,059
everyone
