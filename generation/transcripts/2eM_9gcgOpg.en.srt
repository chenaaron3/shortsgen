if you want to be good at something

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,839
you've got to do it every day I wake up

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,720
in the morning I splash water on my face

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,440
I brush my teeth and I immediately walk

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,679
over and I get into a cold plunge I'm

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,320
going to tell you my routine I'm going

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,679

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,880
emptying your mind completely that's how

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,480

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,960

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,520
