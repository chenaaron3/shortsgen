00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
so today I'm going to show you a sort of

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,400
note-taking mini habit that I created

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,319
over the years that has allowed me to

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,000
retain most of the key lessons from the

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,460
books that I listen to the note taking

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,440
mini habit is essentially this see I

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,820
carry these little waterproof notebooks

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,680
with me and whenever I'm listening to a

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,480
book and I come across an aha moment

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,699
basically a moment where the gears in

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
your head click and something just makes

12
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,240
a whole lot of sense to you when that

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,519
happens I will put in some effort to

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,900
record that lesson down for example a

15
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,820
couple of weeks ago I was listening to

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,859
can't hurt me by David Goggins at the

17
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,239
gym and I came across an aha moment when

18
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,399
he talked about what he likes to call

19
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,739
the cookie jar method so I put down my

20
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,360
weights I paused the audiobook I pulled

21
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,520
out my little notebook and pen and I

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,200
wrote down cookie jar method and I

23
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,000
proceeded to write a short little

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,040
summary about what it was and after

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,480
doing that I rewinded the audio by a

26
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,340
couple of minutes just so I could listen

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,620
to that part again if you take a look at

28
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,660
this incident I'm putting in maybe 10 20

29
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,579
times more effort into digesting this

30
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,320
one piece of information and because of

31
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,500
that that lesson has stuck with me ever

32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,500
since
