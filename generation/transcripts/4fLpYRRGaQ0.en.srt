00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
recently I made some simple changes to

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,240
my daily routine which allowed me to

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,700
double my productivity and I was able to

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,219
do this by implementing five simple

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,980
proven tricks for getting more done part

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,020
two remove distractions before they can

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,940
come up see the thing is even if you use

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,920
my advice and you go to a new location

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,080
there are still things that you might

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,359
bring with you that are associated with

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,460
past distractions let's move on to my

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,220
fourth trick which is to allow yourself

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,840
to win easily see oftentimes when we

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,079
tell ourselves that we need to get a lot

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,160
done we will set this bar way too high

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,920
so the thing you have to understand

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,660
about productivity is that it's mostly a

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,640
mental battle if you believe something

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,739
is too hard then you will naturally come

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,840
up with excuses to avoid even trying

21
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,120
which is why you got to allow yourself

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,280
to win easier lower your bar for Success

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,100
because then you can hit it more often

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,020
my final trick is to reward yourself if

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,539
you do not reward yourself your brain

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,280
will have no incentive to remember this

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,520
behavior and it will never become a

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
habit
