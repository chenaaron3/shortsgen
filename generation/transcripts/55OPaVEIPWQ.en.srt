1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
You collapse on the couch after work

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,640
completely drained. But here's the

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,880
thing. You didn't dig ditches. You sat

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,040
in a chair all day. Your brain treats

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,200
every email notification like a tiny

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,599
tiger attack. You're being hunted by

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,320
predators all day. Except that predators

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,560
are calendar invites. Think about it.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
You check email every 6 minutes, but

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,519
your brain needs 23 minutes to refocus.

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,680
You're literally never fully focused.

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,840
And that exhaustion you feel, it's

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,000
happening at the cellular level. But

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,559
here's the silver lining. If these

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,960
factors multiply for bad, they multiply

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,200
for good, too. Want to know exactly why

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,160
you're drained and how to fix it? Watch

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,160
