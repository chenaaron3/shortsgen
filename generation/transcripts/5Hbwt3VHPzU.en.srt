1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,280
there's so many different ways of

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,880
getting rich I do think you have to have

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,759
some level of dream that's bigger than

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,799
your fear there's a lot more smarter

5
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,599
people out there than they give

6
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,320
themselves credit for the only

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,360
difference is that I start how do you

8
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,480
get a part of it today right now I do

9
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,640
believe there's a a misconception and

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,279
something that most people get wrong is

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,359
that you can't do what you enjoy or

12
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,680
passion or dream about and make a lot of

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,960
money doing it I don't believe that

14
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,160
there's 3,100 billionaires on the planet

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,840
which is not that many so if you want to

16
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,320
meet one and learn from one that's a

17
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,320
really great cheat code of life so
