1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
You're not lazy. You're not weak. You're

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,680
just fighting a battle. Your brain was

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,440
never designed to win. Think about it.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,080
Your brain treats leaving your comfort

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,400
zone like jumping off a cliff. Every

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,880
opportunity looks like a threat. Every

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,279
challenge looks impossible. And here's

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,199
the kicker. The comfort zone isn't even

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,680
comfortable. It's just familiar

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,720
dysfunction we've labeled as safe.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,720
Procrastination isn't laziness. It's

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,480
emotional protection. Your brain

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,480
releases dopamine. Not when you achieve

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
something, but when you anticipate

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,880
achieving it. So, what happens when you

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,399
keep failing? No expectation, no

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,879
dopamine. No dopamine, no drive. But

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,280
here's what nobody tells you. Motivation

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,600
isn't something you find. It's something

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,079
you create through action. You've been

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,160
waiting to feel motivated to start, but

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,559
you need to start to feel motivated.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,440
Want the full blueprint to rewire your

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,399
brain for success? Watch the full video

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,120
now. Your perception has been destroying

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,680
your motivation. It's time to take back

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,680
control.
