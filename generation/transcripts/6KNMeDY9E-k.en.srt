00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
today I want to go over the top three

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,380
ways you can boost your testosterone the

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,060
first way you can increase your

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,919
testosterone is to make sure that you

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,720
are sleeping properly the majority of

6
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,340
your testosterone is produced during the

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,139
REM stage of sleep this means that

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,599
anything that interferes with your sleep

9
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,800
can negatively impact your levels the

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,720
second best way to increase your

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,460
testosterone is to work out a study

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,080
conducted in 1983 found that

13
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,600
testosterone levels of men increased by

14
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,760
21 right after a workout the best thing

15
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,680
to do is to lift heavy weights using

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,720
compound exercises this includes

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,000
exercises like squats and bench press

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,460
and finally a study was conducted by the

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,200
University of Queensland in 2010 they

20
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,180
sent researchers to a skatepark to

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,100
interview and record 96 male

22
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,780
skateboarders doing tricks afterwards

23
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,579
they took saliva samples to measure

24
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,899
their testosterone levels the study

25
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,120
found that skateboarders were being

26
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,100
filmed by female researchers had a

27
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,660
whopping 30 percent higher level of

28
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,579
testosterone than those who are being

29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,559
filmed by male researchers which

30
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,360
suggests that being around and

31
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,640
performing in front of potential mates

32
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,879
drastically increases your testosterone

33
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,879
levels
