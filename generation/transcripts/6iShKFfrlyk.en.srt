1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,919
whether we're talking about small

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,399
mistake or big mistake let's say on a go

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,360
ofl lap the first corner you have this

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,840
little bit of a lock up of the tire you

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,679
know you lose the line a bit you have to

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,639
be able to forget that immediately

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,400
because if you keep thinking about it

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,920
that I need to recover it in the next

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,119
Corners that's your lab done ruined

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,560
nothing good will come out of it so it's

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,880
a certain skill that you need in this

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,920
boort to be able to deal with those

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,480
mistakes whether it's a small or big one

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,439
and I think in that thing for me what's

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,120
the most important is to be um like

16
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,879
self- honest and accepting it okay yeah

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,320
I messed up and what's the best thing

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,600
next that I can do uh usually it is to

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,120
understand the mistake what happened how

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,719
can I prevent it from happening again

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,719
and then move on then don't look back
