1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,959
the past is either an asset or it's a

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,240
liability and if it's an asset that

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,560
means it's something that's continuing

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,919
to pay you more and more you believe

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,960
that the present and future are better

6
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,799
as a result um that there that because

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,839
of that experience you're continuing to

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,560
get kind of interest in the present and

9
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,240
future whereas if it's a liability you

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,519
believe it's continuing to drain your

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,320
present and future and that is all based

12
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,519
on how you're choosing to frame it what

13
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,519
you're choosing to do with it
