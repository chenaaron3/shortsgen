1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
Now, here's something nobody tells you

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,200
about being everyone's favorite person.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,120
It's absolutely exhausting. We've turned

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,120
people pleasing into a sophisticated art

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
form. We'll spend 20 minutes crafting

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,200
the perfect text message to avoid any

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
possible misunderstanding. But we can't

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,039
spend 2 minutes asking ourselves what we

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
actually want for lunch. Here's the

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,000
uncomfortable truth that's going to

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
challenge everything you think you know

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,960
about being a good person. People

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,880
pleasing doesn't actually please people.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
Think about the people you respect most

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,480
in your life. Are they the ones

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,719
constantly agreeing with you, never

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,800
rocking the boat? Or are they the ones

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,000
who challenge you, speak their truth,

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,200
and show up authentically even when it's

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,800
uncomfortable? Wait, what if I told you

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,920
that the most selfless people in the

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,280
world are those who admit to living for

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,680
themselves? When you fill your own cup

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,640
first, you have something real to pour

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,360
out. Your authenticity is your gift to

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,360
the world.
