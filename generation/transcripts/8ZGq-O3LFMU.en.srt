1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,040
when you lose confidence in yourself

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,439
which you will by not having a routine

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,160
and breaking little tiny promises to

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:10,759
yourself um now you can't exude

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,880
confidence and authenticity to the

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,119
outside world and you pay a price for

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,600
that work ethic starts to boil down to

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,640
how do I actually manage my days like

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,680
how do I actually get up in the morning

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,320
get something rolling and do this 365

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,760
days a year or whatever the pattern is

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
over that time to have any success in

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,840
any event field you have to be

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,719
disciplined and you have to have routine

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,879
I call them rituals things that I repeat

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,440
every day that feel comfortable to me

17
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,960
that don't feel like they're just boring

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
habits but they're kind of comforting
