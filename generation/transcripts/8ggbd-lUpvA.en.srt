1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,680
Your brain right now, it's running 73

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,000
browser tabs. 14 are frozen. You don't

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,000
know where the music is coming from. And

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,880
one of them is mining cryptocurrency

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,800
without your permission. That mental fog

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,199
isn't laziness. It's cognitive overload.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,199
Here's the kicker. Your brain treats

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,680
your unread emails like survival

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,600
threats. A full inbox triggers the same

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,640
neural panic button as a predator

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,160
chasing you. And it gets worse. After a

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,040
single distraction, it takes your brain

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,360
23 minutes to fully refocus. That quick

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,600
phone check. Congratulations, you just

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,760
lost half an hour. But here's what no

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,000
one tells you. While you sleep, your

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,440
brain cells shrink and fluid rushes

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,719
through like a power wash, clearing

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,280
mental garbage. Your mind isn't broken.

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,360
It's just dirty. And in this video,

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,680
you'll learn exactly how to clean it.

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,719
Not meditation apps. Actual neuroscience

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,719
that works.
