1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,720
Like I say, it's, you know, life's a

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,960
mystery going forward. The science

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,120
looking back. When you look back, we go,

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,519
we can all connect every single dot.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,400
It's mathematical, scientific how we got

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,920
to this table right here.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,759
We got plans for this afternoon, but

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
we're not sure what's going to happen.

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
But everything looking back, it's it's

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,920
it's all connected if we go back and

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
look at it. And there's a whole lot of I

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,480
thought that was the end. Well, it was

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,480
the end, but it was the beginning of

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,599
this thing. or I caught that red light

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,360
and therefore made me 60 seconds later

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,200
to get to that cafe where I met that

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,160
movie producer or that woman who became

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,800
my wife or whatever that is. It'll make

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
sense at the time.
