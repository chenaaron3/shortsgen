1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
back when I first started going on dates

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,880
I would get extremely nervous so I

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,099
created a ritual in order to calm my

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,960
nerves down I would meditate and try to

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,599
be as present as possible during the

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,759
entire 30 to 45 minute train or bus ride

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,039
to the date spot and when I finally got

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,260
to my stop I would go out of my way to

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,820
have three short but fun interactions

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,320
with some strangers around me this

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,820
helped me out a lot because I knew that

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,560
talking to strangers made me less

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,300
nervous and also since these

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,460
interactions were almost always positive

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,040
I would be in a good mood before the

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,140
date even started then after the ritual

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,540
is over I made sure that I was as fun

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,579
and present as possible during the date

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,040
itself and after doing this just three

20
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,200
times it became a ritual that I would do

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,059
before every first date I started

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,460
feeling less and less nervous each time

23
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,500
because I knew this ritual of mine would

24
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,500
trick me into being more fun and present
