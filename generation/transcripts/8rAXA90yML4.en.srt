00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,040
it took me 7 Seconds to lose it it's not

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:13,240
lack of time that we suffer from it's

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,559
lack of Direction and commitment in Our

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,279
Lives who you spend time with is who you

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,600
become it's time to focus you'll defeat

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,560
the person you were yesterday the person

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,199

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,760

spot you can't move it do not give up

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,480
walk on the court again run on the field

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,760
again step into the arena again try it

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,280
one more time and after you do that

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,120
you're going to come back for more you
