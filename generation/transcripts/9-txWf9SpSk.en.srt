1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,560
You always have to be the person who

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,359
roots for you before everybody else

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:10,400
does. And it's usually a single clap in

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,599
the auditorium for a very long period of

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,519
time. It is a slow clap that's just you

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,320
rooting for you. I think most people

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,320
feel really lonely when you want

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,760
something that doesn't currently exist.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,039
And so some people call that dream, some

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
people call that goals. Whatever it is,

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,480
you're trying to pull something from

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,840
your mind into reality and you want it

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
done a certain way. And if it's not done

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,519
that way, it's not what you imagined.
