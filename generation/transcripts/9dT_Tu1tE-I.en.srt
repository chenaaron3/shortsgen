dark room is where you have to create

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,400
another human being that walks out of

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,680
that dark room you need something that

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,280

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,360
potential inside of you which you know

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,120
it's there but you're too scared to tell

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,320
