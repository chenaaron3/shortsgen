1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,770
so much for this dream middle class and

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:05,509
my mom keeps telling me we're supposed

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,549
to be grateful my mom doesn't understand

4
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:09,769
because she's like you got a bike you

5
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:12,110
got a roof over your head you got food

6
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,610
every day and I'm not satisfied and so

7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,129
I'm starting to make decisions right now

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,770
I'm Gonna Get Rich one day deciding what

00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:31,130

15
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,750
