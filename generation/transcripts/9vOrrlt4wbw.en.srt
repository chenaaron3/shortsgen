1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
You know that feeling when you can't

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,240
stop scrolling, but you're not even

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,839
enjoying it? That's because what makes

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
you want something and what makes you

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,240
like something are completely different?

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,880
We've been confusing the two our whole

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,960
lives. Think about it. Planning the

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,119
vacation feels more exciting than being

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
on it. The anticipation of checking

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,439
messages feels better than actually

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,439
reading them. Here's the problem. By

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,920
breakfast, you've had more stimulation

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,679
than your grandparents had in a week.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,960
You've been eating candy for breakfast

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,800
and now vegetables taste like cardboard.

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
But here's what sounds crazy but

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,840
actually works. The cure for feeling

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,440
unmotivated is doing hard things. When

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,800
you push through something difficult,

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,680
you're not withdrawing from your

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,079
motivation account. You're depositing.

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,879
And the trick? Effort pays compound

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,120
interest. Each hard thing you do makes

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,480
the next hard thing easier. You're

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,719
training yourself to crave the

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,719
challenge.
