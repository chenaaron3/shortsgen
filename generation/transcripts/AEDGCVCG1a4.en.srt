1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,439
research shows that 90% of people

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,160
procrastinate sleep by just Mindless

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,919
scrolling and so they're literally

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,519
procrastinating sleep and literally

5
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,519
putting their future self in a hole the

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,839
next morning because of mindless

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,400
consumption so and we all you know

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,920
that's very common and so in my view

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,560
what you do in the last hour of your day

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,240
is the most potent form of habit

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,960
formation so like what we do at night

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,199
right before we sleep is going to inform

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,199
our habits way more than any other

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,199
period of the day
