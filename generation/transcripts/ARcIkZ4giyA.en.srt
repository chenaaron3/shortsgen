1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
your responsibility as a leader is to

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,919
always keep your head up and give people

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,160
optimism and hope because you have done

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,120
the hard work to get them through the

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,880
tough times but then there's a point

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,679
where it is the fight ORF flight and

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,359
that's when you see the real courage

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,880
come out things go bad things go bad in

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,880
combat things go bad in universities

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,519
things go bad if you allow those

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,679
failures to crush you then you're not

12
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,640
going to make the next hard decision SK

13
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,560
training was a great equalizer nothing

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
mattered but your will to succeed and

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
you always need to be in a position to

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,960
make the next hard decision but take

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
into account the failures you've had
