1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
Your 40s are when you stop auditioning

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
for a life you don't even want. That

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,480
exhausting performance where you try to

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,040
meet everyone else's expectations while

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,440
ignoring your own. It's time to drop the

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,240
act. Here's what nobody tells you about

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,480
turning 40. You finally have enough life

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,800
experience to recognize what doesn't

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,680
work. The endless pursuit of external

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,359
validation becomes obviously feudal when

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,439
you realize the people whose approval

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,080
you're seeking aren't even living lives

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,160
you admire. Picture this. You're invited

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,640
to another networking event that makes

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,239
your soul die a little inside. Your

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
30-year-old self would have gone

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,719
convinced it was important for your

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,879
career. Your 40-year-old self knows

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
better. Thanks, but I'm focusing my

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,360
energy elsewhere. Becomes your new

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,200
superpower. But here's the game changer.

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,440
Your 40s hits you with mathematical

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,320
reality. If you live to 80, you have

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,239
roughly 2,000 weekends left. Suddenly,

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
that toxic friend who drains your energy

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,800
doesn't seem worth 1 12,000th of your

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
remaining time. This isn't about

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,119
becoming selfish. It's about becoming

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,920
authentic. Your 40s aren't a midlife

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,920
crisis. They're midlife clarity.
