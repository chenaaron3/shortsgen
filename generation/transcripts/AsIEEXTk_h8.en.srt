1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,160
There is freedom in responsibility,

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,160
you know, and that earn your way there.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,679
We remember the stuff we earn, the stuff

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,679
we experience more than what the teacher

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,320
tells us or what someone gives us for

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,680
free. We just do. We broke a proverbial

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,520
sweat on it. Whether it's mental or

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,080
physical or whatever, we we we built it.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,560
We we understand. We felt how we got it,

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,800
how we achieved it, how we got what we

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,640
wanted. Those stick with us whether we

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,480
forget them intellectually. They were

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
written in our lineage and they build

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,200
resilience and they and and and they

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,879
build a healthy true optimism going

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,079
forward to know that oh no I've I've

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,879
I've worked for something before and

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,879
achieved It.
