1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
even vegetables have will have some

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,319
sugar in them and you know so I'm not

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,620
saying that you shouldn't eat any sugar

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,259
but but sugar and high fructose corn

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,360
syrup are two major culprits that

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,180
probably have a role in the cause of

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,920
Alzheimer's predictive of hypertension

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,199
of insulin resistance elevated blood

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,660
sugar therefore diabetes inflammation

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,240
oxidative stress all of those mechanisms

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,939
that underlie the things that you don't

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,980
want to get highly addictive so uh yeah

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,239
so so now we're seeing one in two

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,340
Americans suffer from either

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,760
pre-diabetes or type 2 or type 2

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,760
diabetes
