1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,200
Wi-Fi, the technology that promised to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,240
connect us to everything and spends most

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,960
of its time connecting us to absolutely

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,360
nothing. We put a man on the moon with

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,080
less computing power than your router.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,960
And yet that router can't hold a signal

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,359
for 20 ft. But your bathroom door,

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,320
impenetrable fortress. And don't get me

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,640
started on passwords. capital letter,

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,640
number, special character. Your mother's

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,880
maiden name spelled backwards, a sworn

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,800
oath. At some point, you're just typing

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,640
random keystrokes, hoping the internet

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,360
gods accept your offering. Then there's

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,320
your printer. Low can, you're printing

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,160
black text. Why do you need cyan? Is

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,879
there a cyan party happening inside this

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,800
machine? Your phone buzzed 80 times

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
today. You needed three of those

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,480
notifications. Your attention span

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,160
didn't shrink. It was stolen by design.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,320
We optimized everything and somehow

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,879
everything takes more time. Want to know

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,879
why?
