1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,279
you got to be the hardest workers in the

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,960
room and don't the opportunity out don't

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,840
alienate yourself from other people's

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,719
success or downfalls or problems educate

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,759
yourself to it best piece of advice I'm

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,400
not here to change what you're doing or

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,840
tell you that you're doing it wrong I'm

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,320
just simply giving information you can

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,080
use it or not your life is going to be

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,560
your life no matter what if all of our

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,400
lives are going to be the same this

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,920
world would be stupid maybe some of the

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,000
stuff that's worked for me might work

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,400
for you this idea and this notion that

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,040
you could be anything you want you can

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,920
accomplish anything you want the thing

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,920
that has worked for me is to

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
remember the hard times
