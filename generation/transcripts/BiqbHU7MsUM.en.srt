1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
it was a situation in which no matter

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,480
what I did it you didn't quite get the

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,980
validation that you were seeking so

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,139
you're always chasing it a little bit

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,380
more a little bit more

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,599
um to the point where unbeknownst to me

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,520
or on an unconscious level like I needed

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,619
to escape that Paradigm and my first

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,039
Escape was was through drugs and alcohol

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,260
and every time I had done something or

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,539
said something that I regretted

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,699
it was when I was drinking and I thought

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,800
at one point maybe I don't want to live

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,840
a life where I'm continually wishing

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,340
that I hadn't said or done something and

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,380
I just spiraled out control I didn't

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,100
care I didn't want to live I'd lost the

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,100
passion to live
