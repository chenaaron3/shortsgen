1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
things are gonna suck sometimes no

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,060
matter what you're never gonna avoid

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,099
that one thing that I'm particularly

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,620
good at is I'm very good at like

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,200
changing my mind about things I don't

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,900
get too attached to aspects of my

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,000
identity I don't feel committed to like

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,859
oh this is how people see me so I need

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,840
to behave that way

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,460
I think I've been good throughout my

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,199
life of like being willing to look at

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,880
myself and be like well maybe I'm not an

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,740
author maybe I just like had a good book

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,840
I'm very proud of that and it's

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,759
obviously a very important part of my

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,160
life but I don't necessarily see that as

17
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,739
who I am what do you see as who you are

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,540
or do you avoid that kind of statement I

19
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,120
avoid that statement interesting so that

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,879
you don't get trapped yes I'm an author

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,379
right now and if that one day it stops

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,860
being useful being an author I will stop

23
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,860
being an author
