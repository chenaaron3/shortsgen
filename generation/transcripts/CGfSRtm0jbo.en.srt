1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
Did you know that no emotion lasts

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,720
longer than 90 seconds unless you feed

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,519
it? That's right. Your anger, anxiety,

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,000
or sadness naturally dissipates in just

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,000
a minute and a half. When emotions

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,320
trigger, your body releases chemicals

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,880
that flush out within 90 seconds, unless

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
you keep the circuit going with your

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,560
thoughts. This isn't just positive

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,240
thinking. It's neuroscience discovered

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,600
at

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Harvard. Next time you feel overwhelmed,

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,119
try this. Notice the physical sensations

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,600
in your body. Count to 90 while

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,600
breathing deeply. Don't fight the

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,320
feeling. Just observe it passing through

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,040
you like a wave. You'll literally feel

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
the intensity

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,160
subsiding. Your emotions don't make your

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,600
decisions, but they sure are convincing

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,760
salespeople. Emotions are like weather

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,160
systems. They always pass if you don't

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,280
fight against them. This simple

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,719
awareness gives you incredible power.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,800
You're no longer at the mercy of

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,680
emotional storms because you understand

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,320
their temporary nature. The tools to

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
master your mind are waiting for you.

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,880
This will find you when you need it

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
most.
