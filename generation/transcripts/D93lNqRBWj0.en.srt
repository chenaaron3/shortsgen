00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,910
Hallmark of growth mindset is really two

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,830
things one is I'm not where I want to be

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,230
now but I I'm capable of getting there

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,090
eventually the other is to attach a

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,309
sense of reward to the effort process

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,350
itself and if you look at true High

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,990
who are on that upward trajectory

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,630
consistently those people attach

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,630
dopamine to the effort process
