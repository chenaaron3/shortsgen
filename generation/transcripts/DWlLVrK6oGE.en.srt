00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
It's cool that people are seekers. I

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,279
think that's very interesting that we're

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,680
seekers. But we have to believe that

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,840
we're divine and that we learn from our

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,080
experience cuz confidence breeds success

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,480
and success breeds confidence. They go

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,119
prick. I could never do that. I'm not

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
born to do that. Only certain people

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,199
only white people could do that. I can't

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,199
do that. There's nothing I can't
