1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,040
Ever wonder why childhood summers lasted

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,480
forever, but now years vanish in

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,280
seconds? Here's the disturbing truth. By

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,400
30, you've already lived through half of

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,640
how long your life will feel. Your brain

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,680
literally takes fewer snapshots of life

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,400
as you age. That feelgood chemical that

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,760
helps you track time, it decreases every

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,480
decade after 25. Think about your most

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,359
vivid memories. Most happened between 15

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,520
and 25, right? That's because your brain

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,600
was recording everything then. Now, your

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,399
mind has a skip button for your daily

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
routine. Here's what's terrifying. The

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,800
better you get at life, the faster it

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,600
passes. Your autopilot is stealing your

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,239
time. But there's hope. Want to slow

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,800
time down? Start living like a tourist

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,600
again. New experiences force your brain

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,079
out of efficiency mode. Time isn't

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,719
moving faster. You're just sleepwalking

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,719
through it.
