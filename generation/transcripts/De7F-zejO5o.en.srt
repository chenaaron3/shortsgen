1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
I do things that make people look at me

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,839
weird. My roommate asked if I was having

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,359
a stroke. My neighbor definitely thinks

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,960
something is wrong with me. And my

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,920
girlfriend calls my bedtime rules

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,679
annoying. But here's the thing. I sleep

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,759
better than I have in years. I focus

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,160
better. I get more done with less

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
stress. And the only thing I changed

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,240
these weird little habits that nobody

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,320
else does. I brush my teeth with the

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,920
wrong hand every single morning. I stare

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
at the sky for 10 minutes like I'm

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
waiting for something to happen. I

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
answer emails sitting on my floor on

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,480
purpose. I take fake commutes to

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,680
nowhere. And when I'm stuck on a

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,320
problem, I pretend I'm an alien. Most

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,440
adults are running on autopilot. Same

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,960
routines, same exhaustion. I stop doing

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,320
normal. That's the whole secret. People

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,760
think I'm disciplined. I'm not. I'm

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,280
lazy. I just designed my life so lazy.

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,280
Works in my favor. Weird works.

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Normal is why everyone's exhausted.
