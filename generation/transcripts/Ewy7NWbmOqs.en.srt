00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,240
Let me guess. 47 browser tabs open,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,120
three notetaking apps, and a 5-year plan

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,280
you revise monthly. Sound familiar?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
Here's what nobody talks about. Being

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,440
smart might actually be why you're not

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,920
successful. Your intelligence has become

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,640
a prison. You can solve complex problems

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,600
in seconds. But you've been thinking

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,519
about that project for 3 years. While

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,519
you're perfecting, someone else is

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:33,360
profiting. After IQ 120, intelligence

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,120
only predicts 23% of success. The other

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,800
77%

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,680
has nothing to do with how smart you

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,040
are. Your overthinking brain sees every

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,600
possible failure. So, you stay stuck

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,920
analyzing instead of acting. But here's

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,879
the shift. Sometimes you need to forget

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,879
what you know and remember how to move.
