1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
if you make your bed every morning

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,400
you will have accomplished the first

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,980
task of the day

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,420
it will give you a small sense of pride

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,580
and it will encourage you to do another

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,780
task and another

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,400
and another

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,379
and by the end of the day that one task

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,600
completed will have turned into many

10
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,580
tasks completed making your bed will

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,800
also reinforce the fact

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,140
that the little things in life matter

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,580
if you can't do the little things right

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,060
you'll never be able to do the big

15
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,060
things right
