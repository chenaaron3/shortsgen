00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
Let me tell you something that'll put

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,799
down your phone right now. You have

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,720
700,000 hours in your entire life.

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,320
You've probably already burned through

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
200,000.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,920
And here's what's terrifying. You'll

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,439
spend 11 years just looking at screens.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,439
11 years. Sleep takes a third. Work

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,560
takes another chunk. You're left with

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,439
maybe 277,000 hours where you actually

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,279
choose. Every hour you spend is gone

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,719
forever. Unlike money, unlike mistakes,

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,800
you can't earn back time. Your phone,

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,559
it's a slot machine in your pocket.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,440
Those notification dots are designed

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,920
like casino tricks to steal your hours.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,719
But here's the plot twist. Once you see

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,039
the clock, you can't unsee it. Just

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,760
knowing this makes you see life

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,160
differently. If your parents are 60, you

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,800
have maybe 20 more holidays together.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,559
That's not a lot. The full video reveals

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,440
how to reclaim your hours before they

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,440
vanish.
