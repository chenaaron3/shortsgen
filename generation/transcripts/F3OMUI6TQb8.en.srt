00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
Every Sunday night, you become a

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,839
productivity guru. Then Wednesday hits

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,440
and you're eating cereal for dinner

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,519
while binge watching shows you've

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,599
already seen. Here's the uncomfortable

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,360
truth. You're not failing at discipline

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,040
because you're weak. You're failing

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,199
because you're trying to solve a systems

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,279
problem with a willpower solution. The

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,359
most disciplined people aren't actually

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,279
disciplined. They've simply designed

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
their lives so that doing the right

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,439
thing is easier than doing the wrong

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,840
thing. Your brain treats your future

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,760
self like a completely different person.

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,079
Sunday you makes promises that Wednesday

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,840
you has to keep. Trying harder at

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,520
discipline makes you worse at it.

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,879
Willpower is like holding your breath

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,559
for 16 hours. Eventually, you'll gasp

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,600
harder than if you'd been breathing

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,320
normally all along. The solution? Don't

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,480
change what you do. Change who you are.

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,200
You don't need discipline. You need

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,200
design.
