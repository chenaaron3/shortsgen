00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:06,480
meant to live you hear me not the life

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,880
gave

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,280
me but I've been married almost 28 years

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,799

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,560

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,039
parents because I made up in my mind

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,720
that's the life y'all gave me humans do

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,039
not transition to another level when

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,640
they comfortable with the level that

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,320
they're on you only go to another level

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,879
when you on this level and you eating

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,600
out of trash cans and you say enough is

17
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,760
enough when you living in abandoned

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,000
buildings in the winter and you say

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,879
enough is enough you only transition

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,120
from one level to the next when you

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,120
tired of the level you are
