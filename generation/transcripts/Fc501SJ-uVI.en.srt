1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
Here's something that should terrify

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,040
you. You're operating at maybe 10% of

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,360
what you're capable of. The Navy Seals

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,440
have this thing called the 40% rule.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,920
When your mind screams, "You're done."

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,800
You've only used 40% of your actual

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,160
capacity. But here's the kicker. Most of

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,800
us tap out at 4%. Your phone, it's a

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,680
casino and you're the jackpot. 5 hours

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,920
daily, 1,800 hours a year. You're

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,920
literally scrolling away years of your

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,000
life. Discipline isn't about being

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,160
strong. It's about making weakness

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,719
irrelevant. There's a version of you

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,640
that's terrifyingly capable. It's

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,480
watching you right now, disappointed.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
Your transformation starts now.
