1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,199
well you need to contemplate your own

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,279
malevolence because that helps you

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,680
understand who you are and who you could

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,320
be and you could be something absolutely

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,800
brutal and terrible so you need to

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,920
contemplate your own malevolence so that

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
you understand who you are and that

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,600
means you have to contemplate

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,119
malevolence as such because you're not

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,560
only who you are you're who you could be

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,720
for better or worse and I actually think

12
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,439
it's I think it's a lot easier to start

13
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,960
to understand who you could be if you

14
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,080
were better if you deeply understand who

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,599
you could be if you were worse and who

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,079
you might be to the degree that you're

17
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:38,160
blind to that worse presently so you

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,000
think oh my God I could be that

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,399
malevolent a force for ill that's

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,879
horrible but highly compelling and

21
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,399
plausible given my understanding of my

22
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,399
own character
