1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,720
I was not always this strong guy you see

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:09,080
um I went through a lot of hard times in

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,040
my life to get here today all I wanted

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,680
to be was an uncommon man in my whole

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,560
life I was not that much worse than that

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,880
I know what it takes to be a combat

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,039
Soldier and I used to look for courage I

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,640
thought courage was a man who won the

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,080
meal of honor it is but courage is a man

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,960
who's willing to put those boots on

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,200
every single day life to go out there

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,520
and fight for this country when nobody

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,239
even knows what the hell they're doing

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,239
or where the hell they're at
