1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
Right now, you're trapped in games you

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,520
don't even know you're playing. That

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,559
friend who always gets better job

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
offers. They're not lucky. They see the

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,280
chessboard while you're playing

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,960
blindfolded.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,400
Remember that group chat deciding where

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,439
to eat? 20 minutes of I don't care. You

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,680
pick. Classic Nash equilibrium.

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,160
Everyone's stuck in the worst outcome.

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,960
Here's the secret. Some moves work no

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,320
matter what anyone else does. Dominant

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,920
strategies. Life's actual cheat codes.

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,120
Like delivering more value than you

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,239
capture. Sounds soft. You literally

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,320
can't lose. They reciprocate. You win.

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,480
They don't. Everyone sees who's

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,040
valuable. The prisoners dilemma is

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,840
everywhere. Dating apps, climate change,

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,559
you're dirty dishes. But repeated games

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,079
flip everything. When tomorrow matters,

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,640
cooperation dominates. Most people react

23
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,680
while you're following the manual. See

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,680
the matrix.
