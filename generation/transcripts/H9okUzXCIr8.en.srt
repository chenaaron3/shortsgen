1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
it's funny when when you're making lots

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,120
of money it's like admirable it's

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,120
respectable it's like look those are

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,719
traits we want but when you're not

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,000
successful you know you're a lunatic I

6
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,480
have extreme Obsession to the point

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,120
where like for me it's much easier to

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,880
think about something 16 hours a day for

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,160
seven days straight than it is like to

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,359
like gear shift constantly I'm like

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,800
really good at just obsessing over one

12
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,439
thing more than anyone else on the

13
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,480
planet if I were to say what's my

14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,800
superpower it's that I can just obsess

15
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,240
endlessly about something and I can just

16
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,080
have the same thoughts over and over and

17
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,840
over and over again it's it's very weird

18
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,640
like it wasn't like it was work for me

19
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,680
grinding YouTube for those 10 years or

20
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,079
whatever where no one was really

21
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,559
watching it it's just like kind of who I

22
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,559
am
