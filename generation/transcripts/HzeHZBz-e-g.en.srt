00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,199
winter if you start a business in Winter

biggest some most successful companies

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,279
could have been born in any one of those

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,320
Four Seasons they were all born in

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,239
Winter wow a recession or depression

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
from FedEx to Disney Disney was

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,800
depression FedEx was a recession I can

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,719
walk you through them mall so that

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,320
process makes you strong and what

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,879
changed my life was finding that part

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,559
that's inside of all of us that will not

22
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,160
give up you know I'm proud to be a good

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,600
human being I believe I'm a good human

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,760
being but I think hunger often comes not

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,320
always often comes from having gone

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,440
through enough pain like I've suffered

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,320
enough I don't want somebody else to

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,000
suffer anger only gets you so far it's a

29
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,680
fuel that burns out very quickly now

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,359
let's take a second one

31
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,800
do you tend to focus more I'm sure I

32
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:06,040
know what the answer on this one is more

33
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,680
on what you can or can't control there's

34
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,479
three decisions we make every moment of

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,200
our Liv the first decision we're making

36
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,360
is what are we going to focus on right

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,640
now there's millions of things we could

38
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,960
focus on people listening could be

39
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,960
focused on what they're doing what we're

40
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
saying whe they matters or not you know

41
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,200
a million things right but we only focus

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,079
on a small band of things and whatever

43
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,240
we focus on we experience in life but

44
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,600
then the second decision you make as

45
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,280
soon as you focus on something as you

46
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,799
give it a meaning is this the end of the

47
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,000
beginning if you think it's the end of a

48
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,360
relationship you're going to behave very

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,280
different than the beginning is this

50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,680
person dissing me are they challenging

51
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,640
me are they coaching me or are they

52
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,799
actually loving me whatever meaning you

53
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,520
create produces emotion and those

54
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,399
emotions control your third decision

55
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,280
which is what are you going to do we

56
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,240
don't experience life we experience life

57
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,240
we focus on
