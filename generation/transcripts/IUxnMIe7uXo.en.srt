00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,319
more overweight people walking the Earth

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,299
and underweight and by and large people

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,200
diseases of civilization diseases that

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,940

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,960
bad things you don't want to get
