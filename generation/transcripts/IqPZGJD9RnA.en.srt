1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,360
I don't like the conversations of

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,160
strengths and weaknesses because

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,640
strengths often have

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,559
liability I'm really confident okay in

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,920
the wrong context you're arrogant but

6
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,240
weaknesses also have Silver Linings yes

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,520
it's important for us to understand our

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,880
characteristics that we exhibit of which

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,760
some of them in certain contexts are

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,920
huge strength and some of the the exact

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,760
same characteristics in the wrong

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,199
context are huge weaknesses right so

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,000
it's very it's we have to be very

14
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,679
careful when we label people or

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,040
Generations as being strong or weak

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,960
because the answer is it depends we have

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,719
to take the time to Foster and take care

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,360
of people around us to nurture our

19
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,640
relationships because when we're going

20
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,360
to be doing something difficult when

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,600
we're going to be swimming Upstream when

22
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,719
we're going to be innovating and and and

23
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,520
and and doing something different there

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,440
are days we're going to doubt ourselves

25
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,320
there are days we're going to get

26
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,360
knocked in our ass there are days that

27
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,480
storms are going to rise and we have to

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,440
have people who say I got your back you

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,440
need to do this
