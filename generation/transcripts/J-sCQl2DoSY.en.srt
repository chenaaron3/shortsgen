1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,040
things are going to suck sometimes no

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,080
matter what you're never going to avoid

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,080
that one thing that I'm particularly

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,559
good at is I'm very good at like

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,040
changing my mind about things I don't

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,799
get too attached to aspects of my

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,800
identity I don't feel committed to like

8
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:20,720
oh this is how people see me so I need

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,560
to behave that way I think I've been

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,119
good throughout my life of like being

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,720
willing to look at myself and be like

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,640
well maybe I'm not an author maybe I

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,359
just like had a good book I'm very proud

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,640
of that and it's obviously a very

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,640
important part of my life but I don't

16
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,320
necessarily see that as who I am what do

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,000
you see as who you are or do you avoid

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,680
that kind of statement I avoid that

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,680
statement interesting so that you don't

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,160
get trapped yes I'm an author right now

21
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,520
and if at one day it stops being useful

22
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,920
being an author I will stop being an

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,920
author
