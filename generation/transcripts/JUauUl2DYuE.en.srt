1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
there's certain people that you do not

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,880
want to try and beat at their own game

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,639
and certainly Jeff Bezos would be number

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,500
one I mean that'd be like me playing

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,660
chess with Bobby Fisher you know 40

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,100
years ago to be home all over on the

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,939
first move uh Jeff no he's just showing

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,340
amazing talent in figuring out how to

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,800
please customers and in a very short

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,060
time and what's interesting to some

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,039
extent about him the same thing's

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,900
interesting about Fred Smith of federal

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,820
express it isn't that they've had some

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,780
breakthrough and you know found some

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,760
molecule this or that or or come up with

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,820
some you know incredible invention

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,860
they've taken fairly ordinary things I

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,079
mean starting buying books and you know

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,120
but Fred Smith took the airplane and the

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,760
delivery truck and the postal service

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,320
but then he just put it together in a

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,320
very imaginative way you know
