You didn't choose to watch this video.

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,359
Scientists can predict your decision 7

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,240
seconds before you know you've made

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,679
them. Your brain is running on autopilot

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,719
99% of the time. Almost half your day is

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,119
pure habit. Automatic programs you can't

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,600
control. You're basically a human

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,400
playlist on repeat. That personality you

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,600
think is yours. Half of it was decided

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,800
before you were born. The rest recorded

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,560
before you turned seven. Your phone.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
They hired neuroscientists to make you

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,239
addicted. Every notification is a slot

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
machine and you can't stop pulling the

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,399
lever. But here's the thing. Once you

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,559
see these patterns, you can't unsee

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,600
them. And in that tiny moment of

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,280
awareness, something incredible happens.

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
Want to find the crack in the code where

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,160
real choice slips
