1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
studying for hours but getting no

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,080
results. See, most of the students don't

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,919
fail because they're bad at studying.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,240
They fail because they study without a

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,639
plan. Studying without a plan is like

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,880
driving car without a destination. You

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,800
move but never reach anywhere. But top

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,039
students don't study longer, they study

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,760
smarter, they write clear task, finish

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,840
chapter 5, math problems, not just study

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,320
math, because clear goals equals clear

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,560
focus. So plan your day and watch your

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,960
grades change. And this is just one

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,000
habit. Watch the full video to learn all

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
five powerful habits.
