1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
a lot of times when people get to

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,520
success and don't know that the darkness

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,280
is coming that's when you see them trip

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,099
and fall yeah the Oscars when people win

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,320
an Oscar the ultimate darkness is they

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,179
may not work again but you've gone to

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,279
the Mountaintop you can look at it it's

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,440
almost like a algorithm it's like when

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
they win that big trophy

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,880
something happens

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,859
if they don't shake it off quick

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,660
they can't get back into the game and so

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,820
that's my that's the one thing I always

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,560
constantly prepare myself for if

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,940
something great happens just be prepared

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,120
