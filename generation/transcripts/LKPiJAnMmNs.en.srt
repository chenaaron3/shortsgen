1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
What if the very thing that makes you

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,560
good at caring for others is slowly

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,599
destroying your health? That constant

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,920
vigilance comes with a price most never

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,040
see coming. We're experiencing a hidden

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,800
epidemic called human giver syndrome.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,359
It's when some people give endlessly

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,920
without requiring anything in return.

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,160
Think about your typical day. The friend

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,080
needing support, the family member

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,519
requiring help.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,880
Each situation seems manageable, but

13
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,200
collectively it's like dozens of apps

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,160
running in the background, each draining

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,960
your battery. Here's a truth that might

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,160
surprise you. Caring about everything

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,760
means effectively caring about nothing.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,520
Your body keeps score even when your

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,800
mind ignores it. Those headaches, that

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,800
fatigue, they're your body's desperate

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,960
attempt to get your attention. The world

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,760
doesn't need more martyrs who care until

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,440
they break. It needs wholehearted people

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,120
who've discovered how to care deeply

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,120
while remaining fully alive.
