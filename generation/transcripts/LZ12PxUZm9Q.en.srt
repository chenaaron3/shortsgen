1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
There's a version of your life that only

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,240
exists right now. In 6 months, you won't

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,200
be able to see it anymore. Not because

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,360
you'll forget, because the door closes.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,320
You clicked on this for a reason.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,320
Something ended recently or it's ending.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
That weird nameless place where you're

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,320
not who you were, but you're not who

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,880
you're becoming either. You wake up and

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,680
for a split second everything's normal.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,640
Then you remember the job ended, the

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,039
relationship ended, someone left. And

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,880
the strange part, sometimes it's not

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,200
sadness, it's just nothing. You're not

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,680
broken. You're not behind. You're in

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,440
what researchers call the neutral zone.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,360
This disorientation isn't a sign

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
something's wrong with you. It's a sign

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,879
something is working exactly as it

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,800
should. And there are things visible

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,360
from where you're standing that become

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,600
invisible once you move. The Greeks had

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,320
a word for where you are right now. They

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,199
called it liinal. And what most people

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,520
don't realize, the confusion isn't the

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,520
obstacle. The confusion is the carder.
