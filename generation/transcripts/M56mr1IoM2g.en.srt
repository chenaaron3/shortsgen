1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,160
if you can develop the habit of deciding

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,020
what you want to do and planning every

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,000
step and then doing it you're only going

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,040
to get better and better at it into it

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,920
bigger and bigger and bigger things go

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,080
real fast here okay life is real sharp

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,300
and you're going to die early and that

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,660
was a moment where it's like do you

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,760
choose what others would deem a success

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,560
or do you choose

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,060
character I chose from that point

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,279
forward I would always choose character

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,439
over success I've lived that way ever

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,480
since and the odd thing about it is when

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,480
you do that success finds you
