1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
See, your comfort zone is secretly

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,319
ruining your future. It feels safe and

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,880
easy. And that's why it's dangerous

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,960
because easy feels good today, but hard

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,320
builds the life you want tomorrow. So

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,400
every time you avoid something

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,480
difficult, then you train your brain to

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,199
stay small. But the moment you do one

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,439
hard thing like wake up earlier, start

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,160
without motivation or face what you

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,880
fear, then something changes. You stop

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,519
reacting to life. Then you start taking

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,439
control. So when the morning, even in

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,280
the small way, and the rest of the day

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
feels lighter, stronger, and more

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,360
intentional, because discipline isn't

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,760
built in comfort. It's built in those

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,399
quiet moments when you choose hard over

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,040
easy. And I've explained all 10 habits

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,280
