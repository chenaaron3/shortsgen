1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
what stops me is me playing the blame

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,040
game all my life what stops me is me

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,160
keep saying well I'm black they white

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,920
well that's you're not going to go

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,280
forward doing that what stops me is

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,040
saying I didn't have the opportunities

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,240
they have that's going to keep you from

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,199
going there if you can get past the

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,039
 and say all right these are

10
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,279
real issues but the biggest issue is the

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,519
belief of myself the biggest issue is I

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,320
need to spend more time reading and

13
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,720
researching than partying I need to

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,519
spend more time reading and researching

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,359
than chasing women I need to spend more

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,440
time reading research and then you know

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,320
trying to go hang out being on Netflix

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,280
all day playing a game all day I need to

19
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,120
SP more time developing a skill set as I

20
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,760
evolve as I learn how the game is being

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,760
played as I get exposure to the game my

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,760
confidence builds up
