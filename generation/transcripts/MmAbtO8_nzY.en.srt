00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
99% of people in the world are convinced

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,600
that they're incapable of achieving

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,759
great things. So they aim for the

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,160
mediocre. The level of competition is

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
thus fiercest for realistic goals.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,679
Paradoxically making them the most time

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,080
and energy consuming. If you are

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,560
insecure, guess what? The rest of the

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,880
world is too. Do not overestimate the

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,760
competition and underestimate yourself.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
You are better than you
