1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,759
if life was nothing but green lights and

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,160
we didn't have yellows and reds things

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,480
that make us pause hardships crisises

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,559
times for introspection then what the

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,920
hell would it all be for we need the

6
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,240
yellows and the Reds that's how we

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,400
evolve that's how hopefully there's some

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,560
Ascension to our being that's how we

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,760
give some credit to time and growing

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,519
older if we were the same person today

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,480
that we were 20 years ago then what I

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,480
mean what the hell are we doing
