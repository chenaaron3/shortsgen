1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
we all want to be happy but the majority

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,960
of us have no idea what to do see the

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,240
Japanese have a concept called ikigai

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,460
which roughly translates into a reason

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,559
for being you need to have a purpose for

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,420
being here but this is easier said than

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,220
done because there are four components

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,260
that you need to check off in order to

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,699
achieve ikigai the fourth and final

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,140
component is that it needs to be

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,400
something that you're good at now this

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,320
doesn't mean that you need to be born

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,880
with Talent this actually means that

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,800
you're able to put in the time and

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,480
effort in order to get better at this

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,220
skill let's say for example you want to

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,600
become a motivational speaker when you

18
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,399
first get started you're terrible you

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,840
have stage fright you stutter a lot you

20
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,760
forget what you're supposed to say but

21
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,739
over time as you practice more and more

22
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,300
you start to overcome these obstacles

23
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,040
that's what it means to be good at

24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,620
something not to be good from the get-go

25
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,200
but to be able to overcome obstacles and

26
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,879

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
obstacles creates a very fulfilling

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,660
feeling inside of you which is why it's
