1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
I never cared much about investing so I

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,400
was sitting on cash that I had saved up

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,200
from working on this business for the

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,639
past five years and I realized that I

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,500
should figure out what to do with this

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,880
money because as many great investors

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,219
say when there's blood on the street

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,960
that's the best time to buy I ended up

9
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,060
spending three to four hours every

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,920
single day just devouring all the

11
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,720
finance and econ material that I could

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,699
get my hands on I remember binge

13
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,560
listening to an eight hour long book on

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,180
the history of money in one sitting and

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,859
what's funny is that this was basically

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,140
the same material that I was studying

17
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,120
back in college but this time around I

18
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,040
was able to do it effortlessly my

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,559
motivation was so high that I didn't

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,600
even have to try how is this possible

21
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,219
well it all comes down to a concept that

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,680
I've recently been digging into called

23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,540
woo way woo way is an ancient Chinese

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
philosophy which directly translates

25
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,039
into the Art of Doing Nothing or the

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,600
Arts of non-forcing now this doesn't

27
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,579
actually mean that you should do nothing
