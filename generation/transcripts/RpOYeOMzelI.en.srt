00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
I don't know what that dream is that you

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,980
have

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,240

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,519

that it's possible

12
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:29,539
see sometimes we can't say I can do that

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,539
but what we can say that it's possible
