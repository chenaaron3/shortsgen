1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,560
feeling tired all the time it's not just

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,640
you it's your brain paying a 40% tax

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,559
every time you multitask your brain

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,920
isn't a computer it's a on lane road

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,160
every time you switch tasks it takes 23

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,160
minutes to get back on track that's

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,960
longer than most Netflix episodes here's

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,720
the Pivot Point busyness is a shield

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,519
you're hiding behind endless emails and

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,640
pointless meetings feeling productive

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,080
while achieving nothing every urgent

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
task you fake prioritize it's a tax on

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,160
your future self

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,440
and your to-do list it's not helping

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,440
it's gaslighting you you spend hours

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,320
color coding tasks only to realize

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,160
you've done nothing that's because

18
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,640
motion is in progress It's just

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,559
reheating leftovers for your brain ready

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,600
to break the cycle start with the

21
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,000
2-minute surrender rule when stress

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,719
starts spiraling hit pause set a timer

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,039
for 120 seconds and do the thing it's

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,280
not about perfection it's about stopping

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,519
the Avalanche watch the full video to

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,440
learn how to reclaim your energy master

27
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,680
your focus

28
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,800
and stop the productivity Heist your

29
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,800
