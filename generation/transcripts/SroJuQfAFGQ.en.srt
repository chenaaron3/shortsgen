00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,920
Somewhere between your last birthday and

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,800
this exact moment, something shifted.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,160
You felt it. That subtle earthquake when

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,080
you realized the ladder you've been

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,559
climbing might be leaning against the

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,160
wrong wall. Here's what nobody prepares

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,400
you for about turning 50. Success feels

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,880
different. Those achievements you chased

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,039
are in your rear view mirror. The view

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,119
ahead looks completely foreign. The

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,519
truth that hits you at 3:00 a.m. is that

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,880
you have more yesterdays than tomorrows.

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,200
But here's the pattern interrupt

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,760
everyone misses. This isn't a crisis.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
It's an upgrade. The 50's reality is

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,600
powerful. You finally have the

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
experience to know what doesn't work,

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,520
the wisdom to recognize what does, and

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,239
just enough urgency to stop wasting time

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,879
on anything else. Welcome to the decade

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,120
where clarity leads the way. The time

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,280
where wisdom meets opportunity,

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,280
experience meets energy, and everything

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,680
you've learned becomes everything you

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,359
create. Your 50s aren't the beginning of

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,520
the end. They're the end of the

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,400
beginning. Everything until now was

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,400
practice. This is the performance.
