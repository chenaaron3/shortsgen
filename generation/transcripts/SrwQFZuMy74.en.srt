1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
today I'm going to show you exactly how

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,580
you can get people to open up to you

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,960
part two most of the time people just

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,400
won't talk about things that they've

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,320
been bottling up for months or even

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,540
years unless you prompt them to which is

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,120
why the second thing you have to do is

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,740
ask the right questions and not just any

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,560
question they're what I like to call

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,000
Assumption questions all it is is when

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,820
you make an assumption about someone

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,740
based on an observation and see if it's

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,019
true or not it shows that you are really

14
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,060
really listening because the only way

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,500
you can make an assumption like this is

16
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,360
if you are paying a hundred percent

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,460
close attention to what they were saying

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,680
how they were saying it and their body

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,719
language the second thing this does is

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,160
it causes them to react if your

21
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,200
assumption is wrong they will

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,579
instinctively want to correct you but

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,379
what I've found is that if you're really

24
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,420
paying attention you'll actually be able

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,219
to make a correct assumption most of the

26
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,960
time and when that happens when your

27
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,940
assumption is correct they will almost

28
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,920
always start opening up and that's how

29
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,600
you get someone to open up by reducing

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,460
your filter and asking assumption

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,640
