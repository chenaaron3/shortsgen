00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
You've been told you need eight hours of

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,680
sleep. But what if spending more time in

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
bed is actually why you wake up

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,719
exhausted? Here's the truth most people

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,120
never learn. 6 and a half hours of great

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,839
sleep beats 8 hours of broken,

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,520
fragmented sleep every single time.

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,080
Sleep researchers call it sleep

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,000
efficiency. If you're in bed for 8 hours

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,160
but only asleep for six, you didn't get

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
8 hours. You got 6 hours of sleep and 2

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,960
hours of horizontal anxiety. The

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,199
counterintuitive fix. Spend less time in

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,200
bed, not more. When you compress your

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,760
sleep window, you build up sleep

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,399
pressure and your sleep becomes denser,

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,800
more restorative. There's a simple twoe

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,600
experiment that reveals exactly how much

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,640
sleep you actually need. Not some

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,640
average from strangers, your number. The

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,879
full breakdown is in the main video, but

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,000
remember, it was never about the hours.

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,000
It was about what you did with them.
