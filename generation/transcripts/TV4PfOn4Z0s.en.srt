1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,279
This is the winner's quality. The

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,480
hunger, the ability to face defeat again

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,880
and again without giving

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,800
up. This is a winner's quality. You have

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,040
that quality within you. When you're

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,440
hungry, you don't care about the facts.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,760
You don't care about the odds. What

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,400
chances I need to take? What risks do I

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,760
need to begin to embrace? What fears do

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,240
I need to step on? What areas of my life

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,920
am I dead right now? What dream? You can

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,360
either live your dreams or live your

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,520
fears. You have got to get to a point

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,760
where you say, "I'm sick and tired of

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,399
living like this. There's got to be

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,399
more.
