1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,480
I was not always this strong guy, you

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,800
see. Um, I went through a lot of hard

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,639
times in my life to get here today. All

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,599
I wanted to be was an uncommon man. And

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,080
my whole life, I was not that much worse

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,760
than that. I know what it takes to be a

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,760
combat soldier. And I used to look for

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,880
courage. I thought courage was a man who

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
won the Medal of Honor. It is. But

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,240
courage is a man who's willing to put

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
those boots on every single day of his

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,040
life to go out there and fight for this

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,160
country when nobody even knows what the

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,880
hell they're doing or where the hell

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,880
they're at.
