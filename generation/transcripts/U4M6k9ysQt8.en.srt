1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
You checked your phone 96 times today.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,120
That's once every 10 minutes you're

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,960
awake. And you're not even choosing to

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,759
do it. Your brain on infinite scroll. It

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,240
looks exactly like a brain in a casino.

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,240
Same addiction patterns, same withdrawal

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,480
symptoms. But here's what they don't

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,359
want you to know. One simple habit

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,119
breaks their billion-doll grip. The 5

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,359
4321 technique. Right now, do this. Five

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,239
things you can see. Four things you can

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,719
touch. Three things you can hear. Two

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,800
things you can smell. One thing you can

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,200
taste. That's it. That's it. You just

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,120
became present. You literally can't

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,600
scroll and engage all five senses

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,320
simultaneously. Your brain has limited

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,920
RAM. When you run the sensory program,

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,960
there's no space for the consumption

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,000
program. 30 seconds of this reduces

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,840
cravings by 78%.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
more effective than most professional

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,359
interventions. Tomorrow morning, before

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,960
touching your phone, try it once. You're

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,439
about to discover what your mornings

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,320
used to feel like before the algorithms

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,320
took over.
