1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,640
You've been sleeping your whole life and

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,879
you've been doing it wrong. That 8-hour

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,360
rule everyone swears by, the science

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,320
says it's a lie. Researchers tracked

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:17,199
over 500,000 people. The cognitive sweet

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,920
spot, 7 hours, not eight. Seven. But

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,240
here's what's genuinely unsettling. Too

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,119
much sleep is just as damaging as too

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,760
little. Brain scans prove it. Your brain

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,920
literally shrinks on both ends. And

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,079
here's what really got my attention.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,239
While you're unconscious, your brain

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,320
isn't resting. It's running the most

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,719
sophisticated optimization program in

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,680
nature, consolidating memories at 20

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,640
times speed, literally rewiring neural

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,360
pathways. Sleep isn't downtime, it's

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
upgrade time. And the scary part, most

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,600
people have no idea what they're losing

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
every single
