1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,799
Your brain thinks your future self is

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,680
literally a different person. That's why

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,360
you procrastinate. You're not lazy.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
You're making logical decisions to let

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,480
some stranger deal with it. But here's

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,039
the uncomfortable truth. Motivation

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,960
isn't the answer. It's just mental

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,359
marketing. All hype. No operations. The

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,519
real secret? Successful people are

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,160
actually the laziest. They just

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,160
automated everything important. They're

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,160
too lazy to fail.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
Let me hit you with math that will break

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,600
your brain. Small daily improvements

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,760
don't add up. They multiply into

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,520
something terrifying.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,360
By year's end, you're not slightly

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,840
better. You're unrecognizable.

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,320
Your environment makes 43% of your

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,879
decisions while you take full credit.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,199
Your room isn't where you live. It's

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,360
your external brain making garbage

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,039
decisions. Want to make success

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
inevitable?

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,359
Watch the full video. Your dreams are

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,359
about to become a system.
