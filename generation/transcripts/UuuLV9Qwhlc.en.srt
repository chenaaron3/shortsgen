1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
if you gaze into the abyss long enough

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,560
you see the light not the darkness

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,559
I'm betting my life on it bring it on

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,360
the adventure along the Route man

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,480
and I would say

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,820
where's that adventure to be found

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,220
you don't want someone else's fate man

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,560
your Fate's enough and your adventure is

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,539
enough it's plenty it's more than you

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
can ever fully realize and so that's

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,900
also part of the reason that we all

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,180
believe that the individual has some

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,220
intrinsic dignity it's don't be so sure

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,320
that your position and your room is so

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,360
damn trivial it might be your attitude

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,940
towards it that's trivial and if you're

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,520
in Dire Straits and dire circumstances

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,690
just look at how much opportunity you

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,360
have to make things better

20
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,360
