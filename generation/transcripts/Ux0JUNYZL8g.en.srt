1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,399
if you've been victimized you're naive

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,799
and you've been victimized the way out

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,839
of that is to no longer be naive and to

4
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,639
no longer be victimized and that means

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,679
that you you see this reflected in the

6
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:14,000
Harry Potter idea for example that the

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,160
reason that Harry Potter can withstand

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,640
Voldemort is because he's got a piece of

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,080

Psychopaths at Bay is to develop the

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,240
inner psychopath so that you know one

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,439
when you see one right and then but

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,000
that's a voluntary thing it's so it's

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,800
like a it's like a a set of tools that

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,840
you have at your disposal which is full

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,840
knowledge of evil
