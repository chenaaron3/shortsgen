1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
You should push yourself beyond your

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,799
limits of tolerance in your 20s to find

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,559
out where it is. How much can you work?

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,320
How disciplined can you become? Like,

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,000
can you work 12 hours a day? Can you

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,280
work 8 hours a day? Can you work 3 hours

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,560
a day? Like, flat out, where's your

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,560
limit? And how much how much work can

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,119
you do? And how much socialization? You

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,960
should find out. push yourself past and

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,080
then back off to to that point where

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
it's optimally sustainable.
