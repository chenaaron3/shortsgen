1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,640
poverty hurts I mean I don't like it and

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,240
I don't like that our academic system is

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
so corrupt so it's one of the most

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,960
important messages I have onor is that

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,040
failure should inspire you to get

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,360
smarter don't let failure ever stop you

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,680
you know use your brain use your

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,720
creativity and unfortunately our school

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,560
system says if you if you fail you're

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,480
stupid that is not true so the lesson to

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,000
young people is don't take a job for the

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,560
money take a job for what you're

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,439
learning in school they compensate for

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,200
Risk by telling you memorize the right

15
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,160
answer so in other words these kids

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,200
leave young people like you leave school

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,719
think oh if I know the right answers

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,719
then there's no risk and it drives old

19
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,399
guys like me crazy you know we learn

20
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,760
from our mistakes mistakes are

21
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,120
opportunities to get smarter be humble

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,360
and take a look at something you know

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,680
Millennials are the most highly educated

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,359
they know all the answers but they're

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,359
afraid of doing

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,359
anything
