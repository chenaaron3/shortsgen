1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
tell you number one that most of you say

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,480
you want to be successful but you don't

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,919
want it bad you just kind of want it you

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,599
don't want it better than you want to

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,580
party you don't want it as much as you

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,200
want to be cool you most of you don't

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,700
want success as much as you want to

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,680
sleep

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,480
some of you love sleep more than you

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,580
love success and I'm here to tell you

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,619
today if you're going to be successful

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,600
you've got to be willing to give up

13
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,460
sleep you got to be willing to work off

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,320
for three hours of sleep two hours if

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,760
you really want to be successful some

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,279
days you will have to stay up three days

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
in a row because if you go to sleep you

18
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,440
might miss the opportunity to be

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,440
successful
