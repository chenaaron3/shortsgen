00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
we all want to be happy but the majority

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,960
of us have no idea what to do see the

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,240
Japanese have a concept called ikigai

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,460
which roughly translates into a reason

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,559
for being you need to have a purpose for

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,420
being here but this is easier said than

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,220
done because there are four components

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,260
that you need to check off in order to

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,000
achieve ikigai the second component for

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,220
ikiga needs to be something that the

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,080
world needs see we've been hardwired to

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,760
feel good when we know that we're needed

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,439
in a community back in the day when we

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,480
were hunters and gatherers this was easy

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,520
everyone played an important part the

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,500
cook was just as important as the hunter

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,360
back then whenever you put in work you

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,579
could see the immediate positive effects

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,379
your efforts had on others but this

20
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,899
isn't the case nowadays most of us work

21
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,940
in offices being given small roles in a

22
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,860
massive company where even if we work

23
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,600
our butts off it's hard to see the

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,520
positive effects our work has on the

25
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,140
rest of the world it feels like our work

26
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,820
isn't really helping anyone you need to

27
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,199
find something that the world needs

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,360
something that you can do that will

29
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,980
create a visible positive effect on

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,460
