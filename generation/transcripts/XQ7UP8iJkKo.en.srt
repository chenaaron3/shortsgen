00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
You ever feel like life is just slipping

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,640
away? You wake up, then check your phone

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,280
and reply to messages and scroll for a

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,840
bit and suddenly the day is over. Then

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,160
days turn into weeks and weeks turn into

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,720
months. But one question hits you every

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,039
night. Am I actually living or just

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,680
existing? And here's the truth most

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,080
people miss. Life doesn't get out of

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,480
control in one big moment. It slowly

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,119
drifts when you stop deciding. That's

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,920
why one habit changes everything. Design

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,239
your day before it begins and not a long

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
to-do list. Just decide what truly

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640
matters before the world decides for

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,960
you. And do this daily. Then you stop

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,840
reacting. You start leading your life.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,079
And if you're serious about 2026, then
