1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
You know what's insane? You're literally

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,839
waiting for permission to have your own

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,200
fun. That's like asking your reflection

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,759
if you can smile. Listen, somewhere

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,920
between fingerpainting and tax returns,

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,440
you started believing fun required

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,920
authorization.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,640
But here's the plot twist. You've been

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,519
your own principal this whole time. The

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,439
science is wild. Adults who maintain

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,640
playful behaviors have better

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,160
relationships, lower stress, faster

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,360
recovery. People in flow states are 500%

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,360
more productive. 500.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,879
Remember when cardboard boxes were

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,440
spaceships?

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,360
That wasn't childish. That was you

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,600
before the world convinced you joy

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,399
needed sophistication.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,520
So, here's your permission slip. Signed

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,920
by the universe, co-signed by science.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,480
You are hereby authorized to have fun

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,199
without earning it first. Want to know

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,719
the backward secret to happiness? Watch

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
the full video to discover why

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,760
perfectionism is just fear in a fancy

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,760
outfit.
