1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,560
most of y'all struggle because you don't

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,640
know what you're here for and you're

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,279
intimidated when you see other people

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,639
because you're not who you supposed to

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,240
be and that's why you feel intimidated

6
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:13,599
once you figure out who you are you'll

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,400
walk in the room and look at anybody not

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,559
down but you look up cuz you know who

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,559
you

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,320
are and you still walking around here

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,320
taking the narrative that people said

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,359
you were instead of creating your own

13
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,279
narrative write your narrative and make

14
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,279
it plain to

15
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,279
yourself
