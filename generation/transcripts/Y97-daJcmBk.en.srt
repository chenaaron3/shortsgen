1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,359
imagine you read one hour a

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,559
day about

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:13,320
history how much you will learn after

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:16,960
365 hours in one year think about if you

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,720
study about the history of musicians of

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,000
composers how much you would know well

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,320
it's one for the money imagine if you

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,199
would work on the business and some

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,880
business that you want to develop every

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,000
day for an hour imagine how further

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,960
along you will go we don't have the time

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,600
we have 24 hours a day we sleep 6 hours

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,680
a day so it gives you still 18 hours the

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,920
average person Works around 8 to 10

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,559
hours Let's assume it's 10 hours so if

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,640
you have 8 hours left then you travel

17
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,800
around an hour a day maybe 2 hours a day

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,680
so now you have still 6 hours left so

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,160
what do you do with the 6

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,160
hours what do with the 6 hours
