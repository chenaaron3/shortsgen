1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
We spend our 20s chasing what we think

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,440
matters. Fancy job titles and Instagram

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,800
experiences, perfect relationships. But

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,000
in your 30s, the game changes

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,240
completely. Your 30s aren't about

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,400
checking boxes. They're about building

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,400
foundations while you still have runway.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,320
Most people waste their 30s optimizing

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,320
for the wrong things. They focus on

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,680
climbing ladders leading to walls they

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,119
don't want to scale. What actually

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,279
matters? Starting retirement savings.

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,320
Now, the difference between investing at

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,640
30 versus 40 isn't just 10 years. It's

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
often hundreds of thousands of dollars.

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,520
What matters is relationships that

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,920
reciprocate your energy, not your social

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,480
media following. What matters is

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,800
sustainable health habits, not 30-day

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,840
challenges you'll abandon. What matters

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
is saying no without guilt. It's the

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,079
single most powerful tool for creating

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,640
the life you actually want. Your 30s

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,879
aren't about having it all figured out.

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,440
They're about figuring out what actually

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,440
deserves your precious time and energy.
