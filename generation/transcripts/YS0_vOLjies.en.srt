1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,880
Your brain is lying to you right now.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,520
Not in a small way, in a fundamental

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,000
life destroying way you can't even see.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,759
Watch this mental trick. When you buy a

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,759
specific car, suddenly you see it

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,320
everywhere. Those cars were always

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,080
there. The paradox, the smarter you

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
think you are, the better you get at

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
finding evidence to support your biases.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,920
Here's what separates the truly

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,720
intelligent. They actively search for

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,240
information that proves them wrong. The

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,160
less you know about something, the more

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,840
confident you feel about it. It's the

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,239
Dunning Krueger effect. Real

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,600
intelligence sounds like doubt. Think

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,360
about this mathematically. Improve by 1%

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,120
daily, you're 37 times better in a year.

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,480
Decline by 1% daily, you lose 97% of

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,800
your value. The question is, will you

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,520
act on what you now know? Because

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,879
knowing without doing is just another

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,879
cognitive bias.
