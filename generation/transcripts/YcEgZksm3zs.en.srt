1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,640
then I decided to go alone not with my

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,280
partner alone to um have a walk in the

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,040
forest bit of like a hike in the snow

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,679
which I sometimes do but I felt like you

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,240
know it could be nice know get some

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,760
fresh air and just be one day myself

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,920
alone two 3

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,720
hours and that's when I I don't know I

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,680
just found the confidence again and

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,720
I yeah all the things that I had

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,119
achieved previously like you know the

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,040
wins I managed to still get to that that

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,640
point the po po position Labs some good

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,600
race results all that just came to my

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,960
mind and I actually remember saying

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,200
myself I'm the best in the world like I

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,680
I have that much confidence like

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,680
