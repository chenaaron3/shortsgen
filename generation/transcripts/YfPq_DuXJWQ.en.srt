00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
Remember, fear is physical. You feel it

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,120
in your throat or your gut. So is

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,640
courage. Courage doesn't mean you're not

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,320
afraid. It just means you're strong

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,320
enough you push through in spite of the

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,639
fear. Right? When you push your mind to

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,160
go beyond what's comfortable, you feel a

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,519
strength inside you. And that strength

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,640
will help you to change your body, your

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,640
emotions, your relationships, whatever.
