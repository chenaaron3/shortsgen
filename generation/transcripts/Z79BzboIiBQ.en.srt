1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,870
didn't know what was going on I was

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,450
calling out to God to forgive me for my

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,189
sins because I was 100 certain I was

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,389
going to hit the floor and die the only

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,010
thing I could think about was me kids

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,330
having no father growing up and that was

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,549
it nothing else really mattered my

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,650
alcohol is an extraordinarily pernicious

9
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,810
drug and if you're inclined towards it

10
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,029
you can be inclined towards it because

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,670
you're sensitive to its anxiety reducing

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,910
Properties or you can be sensitive to it

13
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,430
because it enhances social communication

14
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,890
or because it produces a psychomotor

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,149
high like cocaine or all of those at

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,190
once and if you're particularly

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,469
predisposed to alcoholism you can

18
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,610
experience all three at once having a

19
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,050
lot of time at home I think a lot of

20
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,750
people had this same sort of thing

21
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,550
alcohol it was just really it was

22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,270
getting earlier and earlier yes easier

23
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,270
and easier to go to
