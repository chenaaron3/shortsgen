1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,080
if I could go back I'd tell younger me

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,879
you're going to do some pretty great

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,200
things but you do not need to be great

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,559
all you have to do is be yourself that

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,280
will always be enough you only start

6
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,320
really liking stuff when you get good at

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,000
it in my opinion and you only get good

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,600
at it by doing it a lot of times before

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,160
you're good at it this is why I'm a big

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,920
big believer in this is that when you

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,080
are starting out I think you got to find

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,679
the thing that's the pain and like pain

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,679
motivates significantly faster and

14
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,199
stronger than pleasure does because

15
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,519
you're sad now you're going to make a

16
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,880
bunch of bad decisions cuz you're sad no

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,399
no it doesn't doesn't work like that

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,559
you're sad okay you get emotional

19
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,640
sometimes okay now get control of your

20
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,480
emotions and carry on with your life and

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,719
sometimes you're going to get hit with

22
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,719
those waves and that's okay
