00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,000
no matter where you land in the

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,720
temperamental landscape you're going to

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,040
have your Associated faults and

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,519
temptations you've got a goal and you'll

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,240
see that as you progress towards the

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,480
goal there'll be obstacles that emerge

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,280
and some of them you don't want to

8
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,599

want to face they just fail to unpack

13
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,320
them you want a horizon of ever

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,720
expanding possibility we're built to

15
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,400
walk uphill and when you reach the

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,240
Pinnacle of the Hill you want to stop

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,960
and appreciate the vision but the next

18
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,559
thing you want is a higher Hill in the

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,559
distance
