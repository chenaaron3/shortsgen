00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,040
so everything for me whether I'm that

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,360
little uncoordinated kid it's taken a

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,880
lot you know it's taken me 30 years to

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,519
find any kind of success or any sense of

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,359
okay I'm starting to find

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,400
myself you know probably 2 or 3,000

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,360
businessman you know now now we're at

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,040
seven businesses we'll do probably 150

00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,520
million bucks this year I got I'll hit a

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,719
billion dollars in real estate probably

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,600

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:44,920
