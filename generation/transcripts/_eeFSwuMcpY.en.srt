1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
wealthy people do three things man they

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,500
stopped trading time for money

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,960
they make their money work for them and

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,240
they give as much value to people as

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,759
they can

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
the reason why people think wealthy

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,180
people are people with money or Sinister

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,820
is because that's what you kind of

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,720
taught in the hood like you kind of talk

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,699
like

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,800
the people who really have money like

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,660
they did some Wicked to get it they

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,119
did some backstabbing cut those to

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,560
get it and you'll never get that all

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,360
them people with money they all Crooks

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,880
because being at the bottom teaches you

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,040
to envy people at the top right one of

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,100
the things that happens often in the

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,260
culture of black people is survival mode

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,840
you never get a chance to play offense

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,960
you're always on defense

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,200
one because of mindset

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,199
because you don't see it again the dope

24
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,539
dealer and the rapper everybody who's

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,199
working is struggling and so you never

26
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,199
want to be that
