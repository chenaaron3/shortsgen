00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,760
people don't like to look themselves in

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,120
the mirror that's the hardest thing to

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,720
do you know it's is to critique yourself

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,120
rather than pointing the finger

00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,200
everybody hates change so to actually do

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,160
that and

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,320

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,240

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,199
I'm wrong in a lot of erors that takes a

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,240
lot of willpower you dig what I'm saying

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,240
so let start with self first
