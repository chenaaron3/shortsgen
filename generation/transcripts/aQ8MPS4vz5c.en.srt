1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,480
the problem is is when you're drinking

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:04,920
you think you're cool but you know you

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,279
have those same delusions that that

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,120
Homer simpsons's friend Barney had when

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,440
he was drinking that you're this kind of

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,400
you know elegant and and sophisticated

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,960
comedian and it just makes everybody

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
stupid I would argue that the real

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,800
problem is that it does that and

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,680
everybody was at the fence and she had

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,560
so many friends that loved her so much

12
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,920
but nobody got inside the fence and I it

13
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,519
made me

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,920
so so sad I drank myself into an

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,440
inability to wake myself up yeah well

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,440
alcohol is an extraordinarily pernicious

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,440
drug
