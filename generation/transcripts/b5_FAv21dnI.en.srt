00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
Your comfort zone isn't keeping you

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,759
safe. It's slowly killing your

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,000
potential. We'll spend hours researching

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,519
the perfect workout routine, but won't

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,759
spend 30 minutes actually doing

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,559
something that scares us. That's not

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,279
comfort. That's avoidance. Here's what

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,680
nobody tells you. Your brain can't tell

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,119
the difference between a saber-tooth

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,960
tiger and a difficult conversation

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,279
treats public speaking the same way it

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,519
treats an actual predator. But here's

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,599
the real breakthrough. Discomfort is

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,520
just growth trying to happen. Every

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,760
skill you value required pushing through

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
discomfort first. Walking, riding a

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,160
bike, having meaningful relationships,

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
all happened outside your comfort zone.

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,079
The most successful people aren't those

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
who avoid hard things. They're the ones

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,840
who made friends with discomfort. Want

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
to discover how doing hard things can

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
transform your life? Watch the full
