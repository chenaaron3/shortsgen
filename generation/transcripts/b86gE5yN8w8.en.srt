00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,680
people give up right before they get

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,680
what they've always wanted to get people

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,480

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,759
moment it's not that All Is Lost when

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,920
you're feeling the most trapped and and

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:17,480
down and nothing can't go right I feel

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,920

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,840
closest to getting what you want is

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,840
