1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
What if everything you've been told

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,600
about building a good life is wrong?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,400
Harvard researchers tracked the same

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,559
people for 85 years from their teenage

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,280
years until they passed away. They

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,599
measured everything. Brain scans, blood

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,720
pressure, career success, wealth

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,840
accumulation. After 85 years, one

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,920
finding dominated all others. The single

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,480
strongest predictor of a healthy, happy,

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,000
long life was the quality of a person's

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,880
relationships.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,680
Not career success, not intelligence,

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,520
not money. Here's what hit hardest. The

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,079
loneliest participants didn't look

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
lonely, they looked busy. Packed

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,480
calendars, impressive achievements. But

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
here's the warning. Your relationship

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,719
satisfaction at age 50 predicts your

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
health at age 80. Better than your

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
cholesterol levels do. When they asked

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,480
participants in their 80s what they

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,039
regret, nobody said they wished they'd

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,680
worked more. The universal regret,

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:02,359
relationships. The study took 85 years

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,359
to figure this out. You don't have to.
