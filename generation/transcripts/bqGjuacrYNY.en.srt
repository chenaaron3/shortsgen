1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,359
Stop. How many hours did you waste today

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,160
pretending to be productive? We've been

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,960
lied to. Those morning routines, fancy

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,519
apps, color-coded calendars, they're

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,440
productivity theater, not actual work.

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
But what if five stupidly simple

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,840
principles could give you control back?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,039
Principle one, the 2-minut rule. See a

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,279
task takes under 2 minutes? Do it now.

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,240
Your brain is running 50 browser tabs of

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,040
unfinished tasks. Close them. Principle

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,760
two, you don't have 24 equal hours. You

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,360
have maybe three peak hours. Stop

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,399
scheduling your hardest work during

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,680
zombie hours. Three priorities per day.

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,680
Not 30. Three. When everything's a

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,160
priority, nothing is. Your brain isn't a

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,520
hard drive. Write everything down. Free

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,840
your mental RAM. and Parkinson's law.

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,320
That project you think needs 4 hours,

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,559
give yourself 90 minutes. Watch your

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,119
brain find efficiency it didn't know

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,799
existed. Now, here's the truth. While

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
everyone else searches for the perfect

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,360
system, you could already be done. Five

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,760
principles. One week, your whole

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,000
approach transforms. So, what are you

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,000
waiting
