1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,920
poverty hurts I mean I don't like it and

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,480
I don't like that our academic system's

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,980
so corrupt so it's one of the most

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,260
important messages I have for

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,059
entrepreneurs is that failure should

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,219
inspire you to get smarter don't let

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,800
failure ever stop you you know use your

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,720
brain use your creativity and

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,539
unfortunately our school system says if

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,760
you fail you're stupid that is not true

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,740
so the lesson to young people is don't

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,900
take a job for the money take the job

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,880
for what you're learning and school they

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,679
compensate for a risk by telling you to

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,719
memorize the right answer so in other

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,360
words these kids leave young people like

17
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,180
you leave school thing oh if I know the

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,219
right answers then there's no risk and

19
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,660
it drives old guys like me crazy you

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,579
know if we learn from our mistakes

21
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,800
mistakes are opportunities to get

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,120
smarter be humble and take a look at

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,520
something you know Millennials are the

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,680
most highly educated they know all the

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,920
answers but they're afraid of doing

26
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,920
anything
