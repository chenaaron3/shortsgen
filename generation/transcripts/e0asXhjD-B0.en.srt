00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,760
I just hung up the phone with somebody

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,240
that I love dearly who got disappointing

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,040
news at work and here's what I want to

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,599
tell you you are not stuck where you are

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,320
the only place that you ever get stuck

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,080
is right up here so whatever it is that

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,960
you're thinking about doing that change

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,320
you want to make the risk you want to

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,680
take do it do it because you're never

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,080
going to feel ready you're never going

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,160
to feel

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,240
confident and that's not how confidence

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,920
works that's not how life Works anyway

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,600
courage comes first you have to find the

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,399
courage to take the risk step into the

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,879
unknown and the courage to trust

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,039
yourself cuz the fact is you will figure

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,399
it out and you do deserve more and today

19
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,879
is the day to place that bet on yourself

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,760
and when you tap into that courage to

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,120
take the risk to take control of your

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,239
life guess what happens the confidence

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,079
follows because you start to believe in

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,079
yourself so go freaking do it
