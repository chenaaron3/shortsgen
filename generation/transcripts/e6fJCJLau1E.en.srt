1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
What if I told you there's one simple

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,920
rule that could completely revolutionize

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,639
your productivity? If it takes less than

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,960
five minutes, do it now. Your brain is

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,200
carrying dozens of small tasks that are

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,719
secretly draining your mental energy.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,320
Most of what's weighing you down,

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
requires less than 5 minutes to

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
complete. Each time you finish

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
something, even something tiny, your

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,519
brain releases dopamine. You're

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
literally programming your brain to

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,599
crave productivity. Think about how

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
often you've spent more energy avoiding

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,399
a task than it would take to just do it.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,640
We've all been there, scrolling for 20

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,200
minutes to avoid a 3minut task. The

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,879
magic happens when this becomes

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,040
automatic. After 3 weeks, I was handling

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,600
small tasks instantly without thinking

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,760
about it. For just one week, commit to

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
this rule completely. I guarantee you'll

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,600
never want to go back to your old

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,559
habits. Are you ambitious but too lazy

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,559
for complex systems? This is for you.
