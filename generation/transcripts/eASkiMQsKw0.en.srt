1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,000
Everyone's pretending they have it

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,639
together. Spoiler alert, they don't. You

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
know that constant buzzing feeling like

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,920
you should be doing something, but you

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,240
don't know what. That's your system

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,320
stuck in permanent alert mode. You're

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,840
not falling apart. You're having a

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,560
completely normal response to an

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,880
absolutely abnormal situation. I want to

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,760
show you something powerful. Draw a

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,400
circle. Inside it, put what you can

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,679
actually control. outside everything

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,840
else. We spend 90% of our energy on

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,840
things outside our circle, doom

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,160
scrolling, worrying, stressing about

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,920
things we literally cannot change.

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,120
Victor Frankle survived four

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,200
concentration camps. His main insight,

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,600
your ability to choose your response can

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
never be taken away. Remember this above

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,120
all else. You've survived every crisis

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,039
so far. Your track record for getting

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,600
through difficult days 100%.

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,760
The world might be falling apart, but

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,320
you you're becoming stronger through the

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,320
stress.
