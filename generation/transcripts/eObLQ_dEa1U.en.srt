1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,319
Smart people freeze when insulted, then

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,200
feel terrible about it. This isn't

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,880
weakness. It's neuroscience.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,639
Your brain thinks someone criticizing

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,040
you is the same as being attacked by a

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,360
predator. Your amydala floods you with

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,840
stress hormones. Logical thinking goes

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,480
offline, and you freeze like a deer in

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,880
headlights. The smarter you are, the

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
more you'll replay this moment. Your

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,160
intelligence becomes a weapon against

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,240
itself.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,160
But here's the game changer. The

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,480
difference between a panic pause and a

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,120
power pause is intention. Next time

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,600
someone insults you, try this. Count

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,079
slowly to four while maintaining eye

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,600
contact. Feel your feet on the ground.

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,680
Take one deep breath. You're not frozen.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
You're choosing to think. Most people

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,160
will interpret your pause as confidence,

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
not confusion. Confident people don't

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,280
rush to defend themselves. Your freeze

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,199
response was never weakness. It was just

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
untrained strength waiting for the right

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,840
techniques.
