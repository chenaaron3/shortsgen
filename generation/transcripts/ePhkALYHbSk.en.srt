4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,400
them are for the next form of meditation

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,740
on our list is guided meditation how

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,900
does it work well basically this is any

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,580
form of meditation where a narrator is

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,560
guiding you through the process you

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,180
simply follow their instructions and

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,279
that's basically it the meditation

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,380
sessions can vary greatly depending on

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,000
the video or app that you're using what

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,160
sort of benefits does this form of

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,900
meditation bring I would definitely say

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,880
that this form of meditation is the

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,680
easiest form and that's because you

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,780
don't really have to deal with complete

18
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,300
silence and the doubts that come when

19
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,100
practicing meditation by yourself who is

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,960
this form of meditation for

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,579
guided meditation is something you

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,620
should consider if you've tried other

23
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,660
forms of meditation but felt like it was

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,100
too difficult there's no harm in putting

25
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,079
on some training wheels and getting used

26
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,300
to sitting still for extended periods of

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
time before eventually moving on to more

28
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,180
