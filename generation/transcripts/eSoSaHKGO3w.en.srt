1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,880
let's say you have no races let's say

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,279
you have no classes no nothing there's

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,200
no purpose in your life you know people

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,280
need to have purpose to get up they need

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,559
purpose to

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,320
perform you need to get to a point in

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,400
your life where there's nothing on the

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,279
docket there's no 5K there's no I'm

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,359
going to get into school to be this or

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,199
that and still perform to the highest

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,840
level if you're not constantly

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,599
performing without purpose you're not

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,239
going to be ready when the time comes

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,480
it's this magical thing purpose that

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,680
we're all looking for but what's funny

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,520
about it all is that we need these

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,640
things to perform but we don't take a

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,079
second to realize the purpose is always

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,039
there the purpose never leaves us

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,280
because the very purpose is you you are

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,280
always the purpose
