1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,359
and there's a human being in the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,960
mirror and that human being is

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,200
trying and they've been there a long

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,160
time and they've been waiting for you to

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,480
wake up and to see them they're tired of

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,840
your constant negativity they're tired

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,000
of you beating them down they need you

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,880
to be more encouraging they need you to

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,160
be more celebratory they need your

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,399
support and when you finally wake up and

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,399
create a moment with

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,680
yourself every single morning where you

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,680
look yourself in the eye and you see

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,280
yourself and you forgive yourself and

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:51,440
you honor yourself and you say I believe

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,600
with this gesture in

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,600
you it is this remarkably deep and

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,559
spiritual feeling of connection that

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,079
you've been longing for for a very long

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,079
time
