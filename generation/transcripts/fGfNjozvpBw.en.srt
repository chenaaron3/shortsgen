00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,760
you guys say reinvent myself it's just

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,560
that I want to be up more than anybody

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,880
in the planet want me to be down and

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,880
that's just what it's all about wanting

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,679
to get the best out of yourself not

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,639
competing with anyone else but you and

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,760
that's how we improve as a person

8
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,720
improving

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,359
ourselves to an emotional level where

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,400
sometimes you can feel uh superior but

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,960
it's Superior in a good way cuz we we

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
sharing a lot of love and everybody's

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,679
going to be superior in that same level

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,439
cuz that's what it's all about everybody

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,760
being equal some people have more

16
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,399
flamboyant jobs more money but the

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,559
psychology of just Brotherly Love

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,320
sisterly love and we just have to get

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,320
along that's just what it is
