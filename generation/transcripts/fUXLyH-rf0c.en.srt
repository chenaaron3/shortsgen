1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
You have a Ferrari in your pocket and

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,359
you're using it to check the weather.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,120
That's what most of us do with Chat GPT.

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,920
Open it, ask something basic, close it.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,880
But here's what nobody tells you. Chat

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,400
GPT isn't an app. It's cognitive

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,039
infrastructure.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,600
A second brain that never gets tired,

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,000
never judges your questions, available

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,880
at 3:00 a.m. when your real brain won't

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,679
shut up. One sentence in, an entire

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,200
strategy out. One prompt written, "A

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,239
weekend of work compressed into

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,640
minutes." But here's the real secret.

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,040
Want to make impossible decisions? Ask

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,920
Chat GPT to respond as your 80-year-old

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,600
self, the version of you looking back.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,239
They already know the answer. They're

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,480
tired of the excuses. Can't start that

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,960
project? Let Chad GPT do the first 10%.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,760
You don't need motivation.

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,920
You need a first draft. AI won't change

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,800
your life. AI plus you, that's

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,000
different. Watch the full breakdown.
