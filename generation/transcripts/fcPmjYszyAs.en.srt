1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Here's something strange. You can spot

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,560
talent in others instantly, but when it

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,679
comes to your own abilities, suddenly

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,920
you're blind. Your brain has 86 billion

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,559
neurons, creating connections that have

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,320
never existed before in the universe.

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,039
Yet, you probably thought about yourself

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,800
negatively today. Right now, your brain

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
is processing 11 million bits of

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,080
information per second, but you're only

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,800
consciously aware of maybe 40. Let me

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
blow your mind. You have implicit memory

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,880
storing every skill you've ever learned.

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520
All running automatically like apps you

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,480
forgot were open. And here's the kicker.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,640
That imposttor syndrome you feel. Plot

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,879
twist. It's actually evidence of

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,280
intelligence. Only smart people can

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,280
doubt themselves that sophisticatedly.

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,360
Your biggest talents are invisible to

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,480
you because they don't feel like

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,360
talents. They feel like just how you

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,000
think. Tonight, ask yourself, "What

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,000
problem did I solve today?" Because once

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,440
you start looking for brilliance, you

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440
realize it was never hiding.
