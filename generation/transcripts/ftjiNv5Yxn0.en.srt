1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,879
ever feel like you're stuck in a loop

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,440
just putting out fires every day but

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,879
what if you could break free and start

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,400
designing your life instead of just

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,559
reacting to it strategic thinking is the

6
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,759
key it's not about solving today's

7
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,199
problems it's about asking why do these

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,880
problems keep happening imagine playing

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,880
chess a beginner sees only the next move

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,519
but a Grandmaster sees the entire board

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,880
planning 20 moves ahead that's the

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,760
difference between tactical and

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,039
strategic thinking here's the best part

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,320
strategic thinking isn't a gift it's a

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,399
skill you can build every time you pause

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
before reacting every time you consider

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,840
long-term consequences you're

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,120
strengthening your strategic muscle in

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,000

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,280
from tactical to strategic thinking

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,760
design your environment to make success

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,920
automatic turn risks into opportunities

23
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,160
for growth build a life where you're not

24
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,960
just reacting you're creating ready to

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,280
stop letting life happen to you and

26
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,160
start designing the life you want watch

27
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,559

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,800
like a Grandmaster your future self will
