00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
People struggle to do things

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,240
alone and the path of the exceptional

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,480
person is one of an exception which

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,440
means that you are not with other people

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,519
and rather than fighting that or

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,000
bemoning

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,320
it see it as an indicator that you're on

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,760
the right path because if everyone else

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,279
were cheering you on then it means

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,560
you're not in the right place because it

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
means you're just like everyone else and

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,279
that's not where you want to
