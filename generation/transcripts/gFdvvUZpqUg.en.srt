1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
You know that feeling when hours

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,080
disappear and work feels effortless?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,759
When you look up and realize you've

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
accomplished more in two hours than you

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,040
usually do in eight? Here's the secret

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,280
nobody taught you. Flow state has a

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,840
recipe. You don't need to meditate for

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,840
years. You already do this accidentally.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,080
Playing video games, texting your crush,

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,640
binge watching shows. You just never

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,680
learn the on switch. The two-minute

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,080
protocol elite performers use daily.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,559
Clear your workspace completely.

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,040
Do five double sniff breaths through

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,000
your nose. Long exhale through your

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,399
mouth. This is your body's built-in

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,640
chill pill. Pick one tiny thing to

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,920
start. Write one sentence. Send one

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,680
email. Then say out loud for the next 90

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,719
minutes, "Nothing else matters but

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,960
this." Your inner critic. It literally

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
shuts up. While everyone drowns in

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,039
notifications, you'll surf mental waves

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,199
they don't even know exist. Your flow

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,079
state is waiting. Time to flip the

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,079
switch.
