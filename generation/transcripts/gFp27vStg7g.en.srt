1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,000
two DUIs in a row ridiculously high

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,399
blood alcohol contents looking at jail

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,800
time a precipice of of getting fired

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,519
chaotic disaster that I weathered very

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,880
much linked to my alcoholism I didn't

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,279
know what was going on I started to

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,160
drink more and more and more and it was

8
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,880
really hard for me to accept that that

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,080
meant I was an alcoholic I woke up with

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,080
the worst hangover alcohol used to be

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,480
this social thing I used to connect with

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,960
people and go out had now become

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,520
something I did nightly alone by myself

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,120
you know those situations created such a

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,120
deep level of Shame inside of me that I

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,600
wasn't able to shake alcohol in the wake

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,600
of those experiences
