1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
by the time I'd done 6 months

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,679
sober I really started feeling the

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,080
benefits I started sleeping better I was

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,080
handling stressful situations better my

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,240
relationship was better my relationship

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,920
with my family was better my

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,000
relationship with my work was better and

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,920
I just sort of said to myself let's do a

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,080
year let's get through the first year

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,760
and then that would be a wonderful

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,400
achievement and then by the time I'd

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,039
crossed that annual Mark I was done I

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,200
was like I've never going to drink again

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,680
cuz this is the best version of myself

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,000
it was my go-to to celebrate and my

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,079
go-to to commiserate you're constantly

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,680
like this which means that you always

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,160
have a reason to be drinking or I felt

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,800
like I always had a reason to be

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,840
drinking I was never a bad drunk or

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,559
anything like that I just when I started

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,559
I just couldn't stop
