1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,160
Everything you believe about talent is

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,480
wrong. It doesn't exist. Those guitar

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,920
gods you worship, the artists you

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,440
admire, they're not gifted.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,640
They just practiced when you were

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,840
sleeping. Child prodigies average 10,000

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,880
hours of practice by age 12. That's not

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,600
talent. That's showing up every single

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,960
day. But here's the secret everyone

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,760
misses. Excellence has a blueprint.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,320
three simple pillars. First, break

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,800
skills into tiny pieces. You don't learn

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,760
guitar. You master finger positioning,

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,960
then strumming, then transitions.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,840
Second, immediate feedback. Without it,

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,480
you're just reinforcing mistakes.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
Third, the Goldilock zone. Challenges

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,960
exactly 4% harder than your current

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,920
skill. Too easy? Boredom. Too hard, you

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,280
quit. Here's what blows my mind.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,760
improved just 1% daily and in one year

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,479
you're not 365% better you're 37 times

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,600
better. The British cycling team proved

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,400
this. They optimized everything by 1%.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,159
Bike seats, pillows, even painted trucks

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,320
white to spot dust. 5 years later,

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,920
Olympic domination.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,600
Your environment is stronger than your

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,240
willpower.

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,960
So design it. Guitar on the couch, not

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,920
the closet. Books everywhere, social

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,079
media deleted. 6 months from now, you'll

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,640
be exceptional at something. The only

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,280
question is what? Every expert was once

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,320
a disaster. They just had a system. Now

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
you do, too.
