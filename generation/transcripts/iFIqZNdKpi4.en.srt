1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,919
these are studying tips that you

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,279
probably haven't heard of some of them

3
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,040
are going to sound strange but I think

4
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,000
it's worth a shot to try these out and

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,200
see if they work for you the first tip

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,080
is to use certain sounds to increase

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,120
your focus and learning huberman

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,039
recommends using 40 HZ either 5 minutes

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,960
before study session or even during it

10
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,480
to help you focus the second tip is

11
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,320
called overt visual Focus all you have

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,119
to do is stare at something for 30

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,920
seconds it could be a DOT on the wall a

14
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,880
water bottle on your desk your plant

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,359
across the room it doesn't really matter

16
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,560
what it is as long as you are

17
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
maintaining your focus on that specific

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,920
spot the last tip we're going to go over

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,840
today is in regards to improving your

20
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,520
memory so that you actually remember

21
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,520
what you study and there's basically two

22
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,360
ways to go about doing this the first is

23
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,039
through repetition the second way is

24
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,800
through intensity Studies have found a

25
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,840
direct correlation between adrenaline

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,760
and the formation of memories how do we

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
take advantage of this in a healthy way

28
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,239
well the key according to studies is to

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,879
spike adrenaline right after you learn

30
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,559
you can naturally pump your adrenaline

31
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,559
by jumping in a cold shower
