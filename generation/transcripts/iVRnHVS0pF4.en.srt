00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
make a

2
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:07,000
plan look at what you're interested in

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,440
get disciplined about something allow

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,400
for the possibility that you have

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,360
something important to contribute to the

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,920
world and that the world would be a

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,920
lesser place without that contribution

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,800
a less common problem than not taking on

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,960
enough a lot of the things that people

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,239
regard as traps are

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,239
actually the means to their life
