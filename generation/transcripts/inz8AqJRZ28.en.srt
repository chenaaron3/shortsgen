if you're struggling with some kind of

00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,359
addiction like I

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:09,200
was it's not easy to say

4

that but I wanted to change I just

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,480
didn't know how then I had to find a way

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,720
to fill myself up with other things that

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,600

break the curse of any family
