00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,400
the world but you keep making it

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,679
optional and every time it gets too hard

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,740
you sit it back down the moment you make

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,600
it non-negotiable not an option slide

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,520

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,340
wondering about the mountain and how big

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,340
