1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,240
Want to break your brain? The harder you

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:10,160
try, the more you fail. No, seriously.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,200
Can't sleep? Stop trying. Want love?

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,400
Stop chasing. It's called the backwards

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,359
law. But here's where it gets insane.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,320
90% of your decisions are emotional.

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,560
Your rational mind just narrating the

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,920
trip. By the time you think your

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,800
emotions already decided, watch this.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,920
20% of your actions create 80% of

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,200
results. 20% of people bring 80% of your

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,960
joy. We're all majoring in minor things.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,239
The twist, you can't delete habits. Only

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,440
replace them. Same cue, same reward,

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,800
better routine. Stop looking for complex

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,239
solutions. Life was simple all along. We

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,239
just complicated the search.
