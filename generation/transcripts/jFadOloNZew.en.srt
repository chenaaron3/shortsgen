00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
Most productivity advice is backwards.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,400
You've tried the 5 a.m. wakeups that

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,240
left you exhausted. The complicated

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,040
systems that took longer than the actual

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,759
work. Your mind can only juggle four

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:19,439
things at once. Not seven, not 10. Four.

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:23,279
Every time you switch tasks, you lose 23

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,359
minutes. Not seconds, minutes. You're

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,119
not multitasking.

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,080
You're rapidly failing at multiple

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,079
things. Want the secret? Work in 20

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,399
second bursts. Drop your room

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,800
temperature to 68° F. Wait 90 minutes

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,040
before your first coffee.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,520
These aren't theories. They're tested

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,559
methods that double output while cutting

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,800
effort in half. If then planning alone

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,200
doubles your success rate. If it's 2

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,840
p.m., then start important work. No

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,079
decisions, just execution. Ready to

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,640
become dangerously productive? Watch the
