1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
your ambition if you have any sense is

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,060
actually to become competent do you want

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,700
to be competent and dangerous or do you

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,740
want to be vague and useless it is

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,040
definitely the case that there is no

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,080
more exceptional form of the capacity to

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,940
be dangerous than to be articulate and

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,080
so it's a moral Endeavor in some real

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,880
sense

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,980
become articulate is to become the

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,859
master of your own tongue every

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,660
Advantage comes with a disadvantage so

13
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,119
if you're extroverted you're social and

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,160
you're positive but you're impulsive and

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,059
you can tilt towards Hedonism and you

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,059
can't stand being alone
