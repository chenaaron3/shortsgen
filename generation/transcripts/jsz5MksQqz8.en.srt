00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,240
it's cool that people are Seekers I

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:05,160
think that's very interesting that we're

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,480
Seekers but we have to believe that

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,360
we're Divine and that we learn from our

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,519
experience cuz confidence breathes

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,759
success and success breathes confidence

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,240
they go hand in hand you can't

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,240
accomplish anything unless you say oh

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm a prick I could never do that I'm

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,880
not born to do that only certain people

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,720
only white people could do that I can't

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,720
do that there's nothing I can't do
