1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
the power of asking is the most powerful

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,160
thing that no one is really improving on

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,720
or really getting started on the upside

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,920
of asking is unlimited and the downside

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,360
is a moment of dis discomfort really if

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,599
you start asking people for things you

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,320
can start getting things if you don't

8
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,559
ask you can't get you're just going to

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,000
get what you get you're not going to get

10
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,480
what you want I think you'll be

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,720
surprised what you can get and what you

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,320
can learn really which is really

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,320
interesting
