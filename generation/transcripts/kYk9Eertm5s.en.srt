1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
that you know that person you're

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,960
planning to become, your brain thinks

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,560
they're literally someone else.

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,480
Researchers discovered something that

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,120
explains everything about why you keep

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,280
letting yourself down. When you imagine

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,880
your future self, your brain activity

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,520
looks identical to when you think about

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,880
a complete stranger. Think about it. You

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,119
wouldn't stay up late if it made your

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,920
best friend exhausted tomorrow. But

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,760
future you, they can deal with it. This

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,920
is why your Monday motivation disappears

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,240
by Wednesday. Your brain is protecting

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,079
you from a stranger's workload. But

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,719
here's the hack. Write a letter from

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,520
your future self to current you. Have

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,079
conversations with future you. Suddenly,

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,640
future you isn't a stranger. They're

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,640
your mentor.
