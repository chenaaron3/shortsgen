1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
all the reasons in the world and I've

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,740
read your book you have the 10 you know

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,299
all these key success Etc would you say

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,040
is the number one reason why people fail

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,599
not necessarily why they make it the

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,160
complete opposite lack of brains lack of

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,240
effort lack of brain's lack of effort

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,920
yeah they just they don't do the work

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,120
they don't learn you know when you walk

10
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,619
in the room when you start a business

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,300
and you start to talk about somebody

12
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,760
you're never in a vacuum with no

13
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,920
competition you know unless you're just

14
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,600
extremely lucky and if there's going to

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,340
be competition that means somebody else

16
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,740
knows your business as well as you do

17
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,199
when you get started and if you walk

18
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,120
into a competitive environment and they

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,440
still know more about the business than

20
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,340
you do and more about your customers

21
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,340
you're going to lose
