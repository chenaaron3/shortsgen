00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,020
a psychologist walked into a room while

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,720
teaching Stress Management to an

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,179
audience as she raised a glass of water

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,580
everyone expected that they'd be asked

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,099
is this glass half empty or half full

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,440
but instead with a smile on her face she

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,600
asked how heavy do you think this glass

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,359
of water is people called out eight

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,220
ounces 16 ounces 20 ounces and she

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,680
replied the weight of this glass doesn't

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,660
matter it all depends on how long I hold

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,400
it if I hold it for just a minute it's

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,859
not a problem the glass still feels

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,260
light but if I hold it for an entire day

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,180
my arm would start to feel numb and

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,280
paralyzed the glass would feel

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,379
unbearable the weight of the glass never

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,020
changes but the longer I hold it the

19
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,700
heavier it becomes see the stresses and

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,379
worries in life are like a glass of

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,120
water if you think about them for just a

22
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,219
while nothing happens if you think about

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,379
them for a bit longer they begin to hurt

24
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,780
and if you think about them all day long

25
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,780
then you will feel paralyzed incapable

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,280
of doing anything so remember to put the

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,280
glass down Jimmy Harmon
