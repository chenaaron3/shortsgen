1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,759
I had what a lot of people would be

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,680
considered a good life as living the

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,960
proverbial American Dream you know I

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,639
quit my job to start my own business

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,719
made an okay living had great clients

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,480
did good work and yet I'd lost my

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,960
passion for that and didn't want to wake

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,880
up and go to go to work anymore which

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,400
was embarrassing because superficially

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,119
everything was just fine I was

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,720
pretending that I was happier more in

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,719
control and more successful than I was

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,120
or felt um which is quite frankly pretty

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,440
draining and pretty dark and it wasn't

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,559
until a very very close friend of mine

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,039
came to me and said something's wrong

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,360
she was the first one to notice

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:46,399
something and I came clean and I sort of

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,680
let it all out it was that catharsis

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,800
that sort of lifted this heavy weight

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,320
off my shoulders I was no longer alone

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,680
it was no longer a secret um and all of

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,399
the energy that was previously going

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,840
into lying hiding and faking now went

25
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,840
into finding a solution
