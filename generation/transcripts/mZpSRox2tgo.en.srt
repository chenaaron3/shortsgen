00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
I want to go over the most common forms

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,740
of meditation how each of them work what

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,860
benefits each bring and also who each of

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,620
them are for and finally we have moving

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,059
meditation how does it work well moving

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,340
meditation is done when you are

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,320
completely focused on making some sort

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,439
of movement whether it's walking doing

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,840
chores yoga or even dancing while you

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,720
move you focus on the physical changes

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,340
and Sensations that occur for example if

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,560
you choose to practice moving meditation

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,000
while walking your focus will be on the

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,760
feeling of your feet touching the ground

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,739
and pushing off and so on what are the

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,660
benefits to this I believe that the main

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,579
benefits of moving meditation is that it

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,440
teaches you how to enter the Flow State

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,540
this is because certain movements such

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,579
as dance force you to be creative and

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,860
present at the same time who is this for

22
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,719
this form of meditation is great if you

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,399
have a hard time sitting still maybe you

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,500
have some health issues that prevent you

25
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,239
from doing so or maybe you feel too

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,239
