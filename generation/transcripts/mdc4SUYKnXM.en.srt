00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
I figured out a way to hack Parkinson's

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,839
log Parkinson's law states that work

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,059
expands so as to fill the time available

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,920
for its completion which basically means

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,840
the amount of time you think you have to

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,000
complete something is how long it will

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,560
take you to complete that thing so if

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,359
you have a project due in three months

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,460
you'll probably end up taking three

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,199
months to finish it well it's more like

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,939
you'll do almost nothing for two and a

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,100
half months and then cram it all in

13
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,140
during the last couple of weeks the same

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,880
thing can be applied to all your dreams

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,920
and Ambitions in life see I've always

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,140
been a pretty paranoid person to the

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,600
point where every time I go on a plane I

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,640
vividly imagine it crashing the fact

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,800
that I will die does not make me cower

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,540
in a corner somewhere I understand that

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,219
it's unavoidable which makes me want to

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,440
experience as much of the world as

23
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,120
possible before my time is up and

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,340
because I feel like I don't have much

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,920
time left it causes me to take action

26
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,840
every single day that's how you max out

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,320
Parkinson's law follow us for more

28
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,320
