1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
but I was never I would say like a

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,080
prodigy you know I wasn't like the kid

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,240
where you see Tiger Wood swinging on the

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,960
Johnny Carson show at 2 or 3 years old

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,880
and you know his swing looks as good as

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,559
it did at three years old as it did you

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,520
know as he as he grew older or you know

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,640
certain players that had that had this

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,720
unbelievable uh Prodigy aspect to

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,359
themselves I I I saw myself as someone

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,000
who probably had some other traits that

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,880
maybe were hard to identify but that

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,160
were really sustainable over time which

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,720
was I would say work ethic and and

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,720
discipline
