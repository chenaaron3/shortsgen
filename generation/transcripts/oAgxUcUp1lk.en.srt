00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,919
imagine when you're older and your

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,040
grandkids say to you Granddad tell me

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,359
about what it was like when you were

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,360
young and you say I didn't really do

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,599
much to be honest cuz I was worried

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,639
about what other people would think of

7
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,240
me I never took my shirt off cuz I hated

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,160
the way I looked I didn't start that

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,800
business cuz I was scared it might fail

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,720
just think about how silly that would

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,000
sound you only get one go around at this

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,000
thing blink and you'll miss it crack of

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,080
the Whip and then you're gone so make it

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,080
worth it
