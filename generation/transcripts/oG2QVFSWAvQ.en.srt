1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
you got to have a purpose have a vision

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,360
I was very

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,639
fortunate that I stumped on my

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,480
vision I mean as you know I was born in

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,600
1947 in Austria after the second world

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,480
war and I didn't really like Austria

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,920
when I grew up I couldn't wait to get

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,400
out of there I couldn't see myself

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,720
becoming a

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,240
farmer or a worker in a factory or

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,480
anything like that even though my

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,640
parents wanted me to stay there and have

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,079
a normal

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,000
life my father wanted me to become a

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,600
police officer like he was my mother

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,840
wanted me just to stay there and marry a

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,960
girl with the name of Heidi hopefully

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,840
and have a bunch of kids and run around

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,800
like the fap family in a sound of music

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,520
but that was their Vision not mine my

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,160
vision was totally different I felt that

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,320
I was born for something special for

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,320
something unique for something big
