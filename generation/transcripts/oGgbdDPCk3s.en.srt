1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
my dad had various nicknames for me he'd

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,420
call me Fireball sometimes because I'd

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,400
start little businesses he didn't care

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,679
about money at all he believed very much

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,480
in having an inner scorecard and I never

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,480
worry about what other people are

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,039
thinking about you you know just just uh

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,100
if you know why you're doing what you're

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,779
doing that's good enough

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,699
well I want to do something I always

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,359
want to do it big I've said many times

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,099
that that 65 or 70 and the people that

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,119
you want to have love you actually do

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,040
love you

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,540
you're a success some people should not

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,520
own socks at all because they just get

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,500
too upset with price fluctuations if

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,600
you're going to do dumb things because

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,340
your stock a stock goes down you

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,440
shouldn't own a stock at all the first

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,840
books I read on investment were actually

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,820
in my dad's office I just read and read

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,260
and read I probably read five to six

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,640
hours a day I mean I figured out very

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,800
early you don't have to be that smart of

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,940
this business which is fortunate but you

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,699
do have to have the right temperament

28
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,379
the best gift I was ever given was to

29
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,379
have a father that I had when I was born
