1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,920
just stopping is almost impossible you

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,080
need to figure out something that's more

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,080
important to you than drinking and also

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,160
think through very hard the negative

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,960
consequences of continuing it you had to

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,000
let a lot of you die when you stop being

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,520
an addict and something new be reborn if

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,119
you have big Ambitions you want to do

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,359
something big with your life stay the

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,000
hell away from drugs and alcohol you see

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,480
I didn't know back then that alcohol is

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,439
the second most addictive drug on planet

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,160
Earth a crazy first time drinking

14
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,160
alcohol that never stopped for me
