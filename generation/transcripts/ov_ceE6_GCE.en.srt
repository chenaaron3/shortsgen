00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,140
today I want to reveal to you the secret

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,460
to getting better at talking to people

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,560
so the first thing you have to

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,500
understand is that you were not born

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,840
socially handicapped we humans are a

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,940
very social species so much in fact that

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,100
you can take a baby and put him or her

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,160
in a room full of people and over time

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,380
he or she will learn to speak purely

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,199
through observation and this is because

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,900
the human brain is actually extremely

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,119
good at identifying patterns and rules

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,619
when it comes to social interactions the

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,660
reason your social skills aren't that

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,300
great is simply because you haven't

16
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,640
given your brain enough time to observe

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,399
interactions and become fluent in all of

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,800
the patterns and rules in short you lack

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,600
practice the secret to getting better at

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,820
talking to people or learning any

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,460
language is to Simply get more practice

22
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,620
to interact with more people to give

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,020
your brain more opportunities to observe

24
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,300
and learn the unique patterns and rules

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,100
of this language so just go out there

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,399
and start talking to more people that's

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,399
the secret
