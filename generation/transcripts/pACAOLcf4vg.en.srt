1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,880
Picture your entire life laid out in

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,120
weeks. If you live to 80, you have

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,320
roughly 4,000 weeks total. That's it. If

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,560
you're 25, you've already spent 1,300

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,359
weeks gone. At 35, nearly halfway

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,600
through. Here's what hits different.

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,359
You'll spend 13 years just looking at

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,480
screens. That's 676 weeks staring at

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,000
pixels. Another third sleeping. two

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,200
years in meetings that could have been

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,920
emails. Most weeks blend together

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,920
because we're not actually living them.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
We're existing through them, waiting for

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,200
someday. But here's the thing about

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,120
someday. It's not on the calendar. Your

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,760
phone, 11 years of your life, that's 572

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,320
weeks gone. The question isn't how much

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,000
time you have left. It's what are you

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
building with the time you have.
