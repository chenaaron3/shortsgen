1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,240
What if I told you that you've been

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,920
ignoring the most important call of your

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,720
life? That nagging feeling pulling you

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,840
towards something greater isn't random.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,320
It's your destiny knocking. Every hero's

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,240
journey begins with a call. That moment

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,240
when ordinary life is interrupted by

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,039
something

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,000
extraordinary. But here's the truth

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,000
about thresholds. They're terrifying.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,080
Your brain floods you with doubt and

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,960
fear. That's not a sign you're on the

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,519
wrong path. It's confirmation you're

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,320
finally on the right one. The difference

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,520
between those who transform and those

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,600
who remain stagnant is simple. Heroes

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,320
answer the call. We expect

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,480
transformation to feel good. But real

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,120
change involves loss and moments of

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,879
complete disorientation as you shed who

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,800
you used to be. Your inmost cave is

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,760
where your greatest treasure and deepest

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,079
fear reside together. Everything you

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,719
want most exists on the other side of

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,320
that fear. The most powerful moment in

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
any hero's journey is realizing it never

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,600
ends. But now you know something

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,960
essential. You have everything you need

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,840
to meet each new challenge. You are the

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,479
chosen one. Not because you're special,

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,280
but because everyone is. And the moment

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,720
you embrace that truth is when your real

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,720
journey begins.
