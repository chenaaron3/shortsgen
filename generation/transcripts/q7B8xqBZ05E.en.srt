1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
Have you ever worked hard all week and

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,640
somehow ended up further behind than

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,960
when you started? You're not lazy.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,920
You're not broken. The approach you've

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,799
been using was never going to work.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,960
Here's the truth. Willpower is a finite

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,480
resource. Like a phone battery that

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,439
starts at 12% with no charger. Every

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,840
decision drains it. What to eat, when to

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,119
out, whether to check email. By

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,760
afternoon, you're making critical

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,800
decisions on low power mode. So what's

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
the answer? You build systems.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,160
Successful people don't have more

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,040
willpower than you. They have less need

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,360
for it. Their lives are designed so

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,680
productivity is the default. You don't

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,399
rise to the level of your goals. You

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,840
fall to the level of your systems. Want

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,840
to know exactly how to build yours?
