1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,120
it is

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:07,359
hard it's hard when you're young to wake

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,559
up in the offseason at 6:00 a.m. to go

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,000
train and work out knowing that all your

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,440
friends are sleeping in and eating

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,039
pancakes no one's good at everything I

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,680
mean that's just not the way life Works

8
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,760
we're all talented at certain things but

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,400
we can really continue to improve our

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,800
weaknesses if we're humble enough to

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,880
identify them and we can build on our

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,439
strengths and I think we're all trying

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,360
to find a more well-rounded aspect to

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,760
ourself but a lot of that has to come

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,399
with this understanding about yourself

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,280
that what you know is very limited and

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,280
what you don't know is Limitless
