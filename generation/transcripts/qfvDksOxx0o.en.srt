00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,840
I think I've been good throughout my

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,520
life of like being willing to look at

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,200
myself and be like well maybe I'm not an

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,660
author maybe I just like had a good book

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,120
I'm very proud of that and it's a very

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,980
obviously a very important part of my

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,980
life but I don't necessarily see that as

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,440
who I am right like what do you see as

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,000
who you are or do you avoid that kind of

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,380
statement I avoid that statement

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,560
interesting so that you don't get

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,320
trapped yes and then I like to think of

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,000
it as like I'm an author right now and

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,040
if that one day

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
it stops being useful being an author I

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,000
will stop being an author
