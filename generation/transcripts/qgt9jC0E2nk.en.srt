1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,319
Right now, at this very moment, you're

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,720
lying to yourself. Don't worry, I'm not

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,080
psychic. I just know that every human

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,240
brain tells roughly 200 lies per day.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,320
Think about this morning. You looked at

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,759
your phone to check one thing quickly.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,880
30 minutes later, you're deep in

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,199
someone's vacation photos from 2019.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,760
Your brain just lied to you three times

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,320
since I started talking. When I said

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,840
you're lying to yourself, your brain

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,800
went, "Well, maybe sometimes, but not as

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,239
much as other people." That's lie number

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,480
one. Here's what's wild. If I hooked you

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,480
up to a brain scanner right now, I could

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,840
watch you lying to yourself in real

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,000
time. Your brain has two systems. One

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,879
knows the truth. One creates stories you

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
can live with. Want to catch yourself?

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,160
Watch the full video to learn the mirror

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,879
technique that exposes your lies

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,879
instantly.
