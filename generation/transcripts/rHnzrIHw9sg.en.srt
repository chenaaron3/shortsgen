1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,600
everyone knows I've had a I've had a

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,799
history in the past of uh not really

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,639
being able to control my emotions on the

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,000
field um which could have translated to

5
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,559
stuff that was happening off the field

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,400
whatever the situation might be I wasn't

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,640
able to be at the right State of Mind in

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,480
that point in time and I think uh Kobe

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,359
presented um something that was real for

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,560
everybody the mama mentality something

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,840
that uh gave you the mind frame and uh

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,119
and the conscious effort to uh to really

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,000
focus in on on the of mind and and not

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,000
to let your emotions get the best of you
