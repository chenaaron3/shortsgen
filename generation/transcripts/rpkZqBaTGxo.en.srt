1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here's something strange about you. You

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,400
love yourself more than anyone else on

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,960
this planet. You would protect yourself,

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,200
feed yourself, fight for yourself. But

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,960
here's what's strange. You trust other

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,759
people's opinions of you more than your

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,400
own. Am I good enough? You don't answer

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,480
that. You wait for them to answer it.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,640
Think about that. You would sacrifice

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
almost anything for your own well-being,

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,279
but you won't sacrifice 5 seconds of

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,920
comfort for your own authenticity.

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,920
Why? Because you inherited a nervous

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,000
system built for a world that no longer

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,520
exists. Your brain still treats a

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
negative comment like a predator

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
sighting. It treats being unfollowed

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,040
like being cast out. That's not

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,440
weakness. That's outdated programming.

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,239
But here's the liberation. There is no

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,800
you who is conditioned. There is only

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,520
conditioning. And conditioning can be

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,719
seen. You don't need to find yourself.

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,719
You need to stop abandoning yourself.
