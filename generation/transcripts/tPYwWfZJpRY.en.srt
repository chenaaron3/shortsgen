1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,799
I realized that reliably the quality of

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,480
my work was better if I

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,599
suffered therefore if I suffered I

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,200
usually got better outcomes and you feel

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,440
good about yourself because you suffered

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,520
you worked for it you earned it so the

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,199
lead indicator of what would be a

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,439
lagging measure the lead indicator was

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,359
suffering the lagging measure would be

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,359
success then this is the thing that I

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,279
did I shortcutted the success part and

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,320
went straight to the suffering part and

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,640
if success came without suffering I felt

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,520
like it wasn't worthy I felt like I

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,520
hadn't worked hard enough to get it
