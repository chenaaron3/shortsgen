1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,679
Here's something nobody warns you about.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,920
The better you get at life, the worse

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,839
you feel about your progress. Your brain

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,599
is running a continuous software update

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,759
in the background, constantly raising

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,960
the bar on what feels normal. This is

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,359
called baseline shift phenomenon. Think

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,840
about driving. Remember when parking

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,439
required your full concentration? Now

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,840
you're probably texting while reversing

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,039
into a spot. Your brain didn't announce

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,279
this upgrade. Here's your proof. The 6

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,320
months ago test. Think about a challenge

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,120
you faced six months ago. Something that

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,640
stressed you out or felt overwhelming.

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
Notice how you're handling similar

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,239
situations now. That's not luck. That's

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,160
measurable progress your brain forgot to

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,719
celebrate. You're walking around with

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,879
skills you don't think you have. When

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,200
someone asks for advice, you probably

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,920
don't feel qualified, but you gave great

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,800
advice anyway. Your expertise has become

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,719
invisible because it feels normal to

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,039
you. But expertise doesn't feel like

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,000
expertise from the inside. It feels like

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,159
common sense. The truth is, you're doing

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,040
better than you think, and there's

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,520
scientific proof. Watch the full video

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,280
to discover the other hidden signs of

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,479
your progress that you've been

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,479
completely missing.
