1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,680
that coworker who's perfectly alert on 6

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,759
hours while you're dragging after 8.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,800
There's a scientific reason the Japanese

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,200
sleep just 6.5 hours but live longer

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,560
with more energy than Americans sleeping

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,279
7.5. They're secret. They don't count

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,160
hours, they count cycles. Your brain

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,519
runs 90minute sleep cycles.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,599
Wake at 6 or 7.5 hours, you're golden.

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,480
But 8 hours, you're literally

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,160
interrupting your brain midcycle.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,559
It's like leaving a movie during the

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,840
climax. The Japanese treat bedrooms at

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,920
60 to 64° F, 5° cooler than yours. Your

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,360
body needs to drop temperature for deep

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,000
sleep. Plus, they master inimury

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,840
strategic napping. NASA approved

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
26-minute naps boost performance 34%.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,879
Set your alarm for 6, 7.5, or 9 hours.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,760
Never 7 or 8. Tonight you begin Japanese

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,239
sleep mastery. Tomorrow you wake up

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,239
fresh.
