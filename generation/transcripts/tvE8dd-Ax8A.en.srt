1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,160
Look, worry is basically your brain

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,160
doing mental push-ups for imaginary

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,160
problem. Your brain has this fascinating

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
habit. It acts like a security guard who

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,000
thinks every shadow is a burglar. We're

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,000
scanning for LinkedIn notifications

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679
while actual tigers remain noticeably

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,760
absent from our daily commute. Here's

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,760
the truth. Bomb anxiety is just time

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,039
travel with poor Wi-Fi connection.

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,119
You're trying to live tomorrow's

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,439
problems with yesterday's fears while

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,680
missing today's life. Notice how right

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,199
now in this exact moment, you're

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,599
probably fine. Yet somewhere in your

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,360
mind, there's a tiny CEO holding

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
emergency meetings about stuff that

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,160
might happen. When you seal today's

19
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,200
compartment, something incredible

20
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,320
happens. Your problem-solving ability

21
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,960
skyrockets because your full mental

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,520
bandwidth focuses on actual challenges.

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,920
We spend 90% of our mental energy trying

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
to control the 10% we can't influence.

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
Meanwhile, the things we can control get

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,440
minimal attention. Your future self

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
isn't sitting in tomorrow wishing you'd

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,800
worried harder. They're reading your

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
worries like old diary entries and

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,760
laughing. When you stop worrying,

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
everything doesn't just start to go

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,080
well. Everything reveals its inherent

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
wellness. You haven't been fixing life.
