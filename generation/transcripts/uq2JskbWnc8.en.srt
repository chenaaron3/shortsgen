1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,639
and having these setbacks where I can't

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,960
even run a mile but I'm thinking about

3
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:09,639
running

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,799
135 I can't run one mile and what if I

5
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:15,119
can win it it's a mental standard you

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,359
must meet in life

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:23,320
motivation has an expiration

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:26,240
date and when motivation dies discipline

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,240
must take it Place pick something rather

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,279
than nothing or pick something rather

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,040
than all things and then set yourself to

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,879
master that you need to have a primary

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,640
discipline it's absolutely necessary to

14
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,200
succeed in life now once you have a

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,920
primary discipline then you can Branch

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,320
out and and become a multiplicity in

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
your disciplined approach and then

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,120
you're absolutely bloody Unstoppable but

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,680
you really need that initial

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,680
disciplinary

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,680
routine
