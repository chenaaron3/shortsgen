1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
those blind to your future are

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:08,400
disqualified to be a part of it what

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,599
mask itself as Madness in the beginning

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,839
will eventually be recognized as genius

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,199
in the end the enemy is no match for the

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,119
faith that set that dream in motion what

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,240
the blind can't see they call Madness

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:26,519
our active imagination is the alchemy

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,039
that transforms spiritual truth into

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,439
physical equivalence those who display

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,360
genius those who rejected greatness

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
those who arose from nothing to become

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,200
something were all first laughed at

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,360
doubted and made fun of the rejection of

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,360
the world did not stop them it merely

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,039
incipient to even higher levels of

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,640
achievement what the blind can't see

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,640
they call Madness
