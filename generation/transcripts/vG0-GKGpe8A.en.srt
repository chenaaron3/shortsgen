1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,400
the school system was designed to teach

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,960
you to be an employee which is important

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,360
or a doctor or a lawyer a specialist but

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,920
never about money you've really got to

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,240
understand what is risky and what is not

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,560
risky and in my world if you play it

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,000
safe that makes you stupid because if

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,680
you don't take risk you don't get

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,160
smarter and when somebody says what is

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,439
risk you have to look in the mirror you

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,960
know I mean for me to fly in Vietnam

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,879
that was high risk but the higher the

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,960
risk the more you have to study you know

14
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,239
that I know that well first of all

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,440
everybody can do

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,559
something but they won't and that's the

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,320
problem the point is everybody can do

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,480
something but you got to figure out what

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,280
you can do poor people say I can't

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,520
afford it I can't do that I don't have

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,879
time because this an

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,879
escape it's an Escape
