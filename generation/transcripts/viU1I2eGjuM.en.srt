1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,880
ever notice how vacation days seem to

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,839
last forever while work weeks disappear

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,639
in a blur that's not just your

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,360
imagination it's

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,200
Neuroscience the memory Mirage is the

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,799
illusion that productive days are good

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,000
days but our brains create memories

8
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:20,600
based on sensory experiences not

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,400
completed tasks the average person

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
spends nearly half their waking hours

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,439
with their mind wandering literally

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,640
missing half their life your 17 waking

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,160
hours divide into four energy phases

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,360
that should determine when you do

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,879
activities fighting these natural

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,399
rhythms reduces performance by

17
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,000
30% your perfect day isn't about doing

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,000
more it's about experiencing more

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,559
through sensory awareness even a 5minute

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,399
genuine conversation can boost

21
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,039
performance for two hours afterward the

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,359
perfect day is designed to be truly

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,120
lived and remembered and that perfect

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,120
day is available to you starting

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,120
tomorrow
