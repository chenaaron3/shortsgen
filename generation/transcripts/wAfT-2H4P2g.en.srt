1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
and this is something that you know

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,279
Jimmy tells a lot of content creators is

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,259
like your first hundred videos are gonna

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,540
suck so it's like once you get to that

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,980
like 100 video go back and look at the

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,840
first five and you're gonna cringe at

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,120
how bad it was and so you really have to

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,460
focus on making each video better than

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,660
the next this is a long game and if

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,400
you're not willing to put in the time

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,560
and effort like don't even compete

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,160
because it is hyper competitive right

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,160
now for attention
