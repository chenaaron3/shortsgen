1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,279
Every generation thinks they invented

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,440
struggle and somehow every generation is

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,920
absolutely certain the other ones don't

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,639
get it. We throw around labels like

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,720
weapons. Okay, boomer snowflake.

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,840
Each one designed to dismiss rather than

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,519
understand. But here's what gets missed.

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,359
In 1970, the median home price was 2.5

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,480
times annual income. Today, nearly six

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000
times. That's not laziness. That's

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,520
mathematics.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,920
Boomers weren't always the

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,760
establishment. They were the hippies,

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,239
the protesters.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,719
Millennials aren't entitled. They're the

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,640
most educated generation in history,

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,600
working jobs that didn't exist when they

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,640
started college. And Gen Z's short

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,360
attention span, they process information

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,480
faster than any generation before them.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,920
Here's the plot twist. Gen Z and boomers

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,480
actually have more in common with each

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,760
other than either has with millennials.

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,760
Same humans, different histories, one

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,760
shared future. Labels lie.
