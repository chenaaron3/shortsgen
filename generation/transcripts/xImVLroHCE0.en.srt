1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,080
You're lying in bed at 2 p.m. still in

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,600
yesterday's clothes. Sound familiar?

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,840
Most people in their 20s are

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,800
experiencing the exact same motivational

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,759
death. You spent 16 years training for

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,560
clear goals. Homework, grades,

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,119
validation. Then you graduated and the

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,439
scoreboard disappeared.

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,920
Just an endless void called the rest of

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,720
your life. Your brain is literally

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,359
confused. It's bored with good things.

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
that promotion you worked two years for.

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,079
Your brain celebrates for two days, then

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
asks, "What's next?" Meanwhile, you're

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,000
drowning in infinite choices while

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,559
everyone on LinkedIn is thrilled to

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,559
announce their success. Your 20s are

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,160
supposed to be messy. Delete the

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,559
timeline. Burn the comparison scorecard.

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,559
Your motivation isn't broken. It's been

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,960
hijacked by expectations that were never

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,960
yours. Take your motivation back.
