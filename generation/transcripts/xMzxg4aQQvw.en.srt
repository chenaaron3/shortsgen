1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,600
we always say and I'm guilty of this too

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,280
I got to I got to go to

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,000
work I got to put the time in I got to

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,759
do this thing I got to do that thing I

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,839
got to work out I got to go train I got

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,800
to I got to I got to as opposed to

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,920
saying I get to I get to go to work I

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,320
get to pay that bill I get to go to the

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,720
gym I get to work out so this idea that

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,240
you shift from I got to to I get to

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,000
because what I realized is when I

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,399
mentally shifted to ah everything all

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,719
the stuff I got to do is all the stuff

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,719
that I'm blessed to get to do
