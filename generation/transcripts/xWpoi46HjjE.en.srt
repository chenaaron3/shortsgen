00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
today I'm going to show you exactly how

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,279
you can get people to open up to you

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,259
part one first you have to learn to

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,240
reduce your filter if you think about it

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,460
the reason why we are scared to say

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,040
certain things or to act in certain ways

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,960
is because we are afraid of how others

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,520
will react instead of talking about

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,980
things that we really want to talk about

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,320
we put on a filter and we spend most of

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,840
our time conversing in small talk but

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,820
secretly deep down inside we're all

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,220
looking for someone who we can share our

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,660
strange thoughts and ideas with now if

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,279
you come along and you show them from

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,800
the start that you don't really care

17
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,480
about being a perfect snowflake that you

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
don't really filter yourself and that

19
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,780
you are willing to talk about things

20
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,660
that are deemed as socially unacceptable

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,700
or strange then people will want to open

22
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,739
up to you now it's very important to

23
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,780
note that there is a fine line between

24
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,640
being seen as someone who has a reduced

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,680
filter and being seen as someone who is

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,899
just plain old crazy and it all depends

27
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,640
on your perceived value if your value is

28
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,379
too low people will just think that

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,620
