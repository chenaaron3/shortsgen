1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,279
imagine you read 1 hour a

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:08,480
day about

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:13,280
history how much you will learn after

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,880
365 hours in one year think about if you

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,680
study about the history of musicians of

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,960
composers how much you would know well

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,279
it's one for the money imagine if you

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,160
would work on the business and some

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,800
business that you want to develop every

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,960
day for an hour imagine how further

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,879
along you will go we don't have the time

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:39,520
we have 24 hours a day we sleep 6 hours

13
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,640
a day so it gives you still 18 hours the

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,840
average person Works around 8 to 10

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,480
hours Let's assume it's 10 hours so if

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,559
you have 8 hours left then you travel

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,719
around an hour a day maybe 2 hours a day

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,640
so now you have still 6 hours left so

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,160
what do you do with the 6

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,160
hours what do with 6 hours
