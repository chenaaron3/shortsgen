00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
Your textbook looks like a rainbow threw

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,799
up on it and somehow you think that's

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,720
studying. The research is absolutely

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,719
shocking. Highlighting doesn't just fail

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,840
to help your memory. It actually makes

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,080
retention worse. You forget 50% of new

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,240
information within 1 hour. Half of

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,320
everything you just studied vanishes

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,400
before you finish your coffee. But

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,800
here's the good news. Your brain isn't

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,039
broken. Your methods are. Stop feeding

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
your brain. Make it hunt for food. Close

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,119
your book and write down everything you

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,200
remember. You'll feel stupid at first.

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,440
That feeling means it's working. The

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
science proves this works. Students who

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,360
use active recall retain 50% more

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
information than those who just reread

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,960
material. Your brain loves surprises.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,760
Review after one day, then 3 days, then

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,079
one week. Each review should happen just

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,079
as you're about to forget. The future

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,960
belongs to learners. And now you know

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,960
how to learn.
