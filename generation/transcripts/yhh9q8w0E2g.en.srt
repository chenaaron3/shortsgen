1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
we all want to be happy but the majority

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,960
of us have no idea what to do see the

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,240
Japanese have a concept called ikigai

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,460
which roughly translates into a reason

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,559
for being you need to have a purpose for

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,420
being here but this is easier said than

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,220
done because there are four components

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,320
that you need to check off in order to

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,820
achieve ikigai the first component is

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,500
that it needs to be something that you

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,060
love we all have things that make us

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,980
feel good things that make us stop

13
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,019
thinking for short periods of time to

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,000
just be present and aware of what's

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,439
happening right now in front of us the

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
more technical people will call this

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,460
Flow State but the majority of us call

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,040
it love that's why so many of us enjoy

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,020
the Arts drawing dancing singing reading

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,940
because it takes us into the state of

21
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,739
bliss where we feel good and are focused

22
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,180
on the task in front of us that's why

23
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,100
some of us fall in love with one another

24
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,719
because being with that person allows us

25
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,879
to forget about all the other problems

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,260
in our lives at least momentarily I

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,879
don't need to get into too much detail

28
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,680
about this component because we know in

29
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,600
our gut when we truly love to do

30
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,340
something it's a feeling that we humans

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,579
all share follow us for more helpful
