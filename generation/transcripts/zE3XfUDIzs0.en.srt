1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,069
why is it that smart people are at the

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,330
top of dominance hierarchies and the

3
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:07,190
answer to that in part is because they

4
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,010
get there first right I mean

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,510
everything's a race roughly speaking and

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,950
the faster you are the more likely you

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,530
are to be at the Forefront of the pack

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,050
and intelligence in large part is speed

9
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,910
that's not all of it is so if you're

10
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,830
moving towards something difficult

11
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,369
rapidly the faster people are going to

12
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,369
get there first
