1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
the closer you get to

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,919
Victory the more aggressive the enemy

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,080
gets I've learned that the moment we

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:12,280
want to give up most is usually at the

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,080
dawn of our breakthrough we are right

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,520
there at the gate we just can't see it

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,480
it's a water of mind you got to see that

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,880
dream with your imagination so clear

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,519
that you bend reality around what you

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,720
want when a dreamer gets called stubborn

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,320
by the world he wears it proudly like a

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,559
badge of honor he knows that the ad

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,000
person should never understand what he's

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,920
doing why he's doing it nor should they

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,600
ever believe that it's possible for him

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,079
to achieve it the world's rejection and

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
unwavering resistance are his biggest

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,800
confirmation that he's on the right

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,800
track
