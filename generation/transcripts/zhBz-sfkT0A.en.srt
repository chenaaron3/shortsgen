1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
You know that Sunday night dread? You're

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,680
not anxious. You're not broken. You're

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,920
playing the wrong game. Most of us are

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,160
NPCs in someone else's game. Following

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,040
scripts we never wrote. Chasing goals we

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,520
never chose. Living the dream. Yeah.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,359
Whose dream exactly? Here's what nobody

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,160
tells you. You're using the wrong

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,720
scoreboard. Salary, followers, status.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,720
These metrics, they're measuring someone

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,840
else's game, not yours. The plot twist.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,079
Your authentic game already exists. You

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
don't have to create it. You have to

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,800
uncover it. Pay attention to what you do

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,160
when you procrastinate. Those rabbit

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,520
holes, those midnight conversations,

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,760
that's you escaping to your game. The

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,320
ultimate truth. When you stop trying to

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,320
win their game, you start succeeding at

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,320
yours.
