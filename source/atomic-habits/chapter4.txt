Chapter 4 of Atomic Habits by James Clear* introduces the First Law of Behavior Change — Make It Obvious — arguing that habits are largely driven by cues in our environment and that most bad habits persist because we are unaware of the triggers that cause them. Clear explains that before you can change a habit, you must make it visible through techniques like the “Habit Scorecard,” which builds awareness of automatic behaviors, and “implementation intentions,” which specify exactly when and where you will act (“I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]”). He emphasizes that environment design is more powerful than willpower: by strategically placing cues in your surroundings, you make good habits easier to notice and bad habits harder to trigger, shifting behavior through design rather than discipline.
