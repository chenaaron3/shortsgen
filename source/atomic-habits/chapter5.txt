Chapter 5 of Atomic Habits by James Clear* explains that the most effective way to start a new habit is through habit stacking—attaching a desired behavior to an existing routine using the formula “After I [current habit], I will [new habit].” Because your current habits already serve as reliable cues, linking a new action to them leverages established neural pathways, making the behavior more automatic and easier to repeat. Clear emphasizes being specific about when and where the habit will occur, as clarity reduces friction and increases follow-through, allowing small actions to compound into consistent routines over time.
