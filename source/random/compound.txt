The compounding effect in financial terms refers to the process where an investment generates earnings, and those earnings are reinvested to generate their own earnings over time. Instead of growing in a straight line, money grows exponentially because each period’s returns build on the previous total. For example, if you invest $10,000 at a 7% annual return, you don’t just earn 7% on the original $10,000 each year — you earn 7% on the growing balance, including past interest. Over long periods, this snowball effect can dramatically increase wealth, which is why starting early and staying invested are often more important than trying to time the market!
